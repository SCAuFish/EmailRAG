Then it saw a better\ndeal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting\nunheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is\nselling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it\npays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.\nIt is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in\nenergy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even\noil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or\nnatural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large\nindustrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --\nwill free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they\nalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum\nand fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to\nconsumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.\n\"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know\nwhat they're going to use to grow crops with,\" said David Wyss, chief\neconomist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased\ntheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on\nan already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated\nthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a\ntypical U.S. household.\nThat and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher\nenergy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected\ngrowth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual\nrate in the first three months of next year. \"Overall, the recent energy\nprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic\nslowdown,\" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in\nSioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use\nnatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the\ncompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in\nDecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,\nwhich are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its\nexisting December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative\nofficer.\n\"We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' \" he said.\nTerra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but\nRosenbury said it would be \"substantial.\"  In coming months, Terra's good\nfortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the\nprices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even\npoint. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate\nthe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. \"If this persists,\"\nRosenbury said, \"it's going to be a real problem.\"\nHe estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18\nmillion tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating\nnow. \"Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that\nfarmers will not have as much as they want,\" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark\nInc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and\ndistributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,\nindefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next\nmonth. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify\ncontinued production. \"We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble\n[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to\nbuy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,\" said Paul\nM. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A\ncontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and\nraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to\nplant feed corn, he said. \"It's sticker shock.\"\nAccording to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas\nremains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --\nfarm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the\naluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the\nindustry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an\nanalyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.\nAluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,\nand December's production will be lower still, he said. \"We'll get more\nproduction cut announcements, I think,\" he said. A slowing in the U.S. and\nworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum\nsupplies. \"But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then\n[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more\nthan the current forecast,\" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question\nhow much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually\nentitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,\nsays spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville\nfor $550 a megawatt hour for December.\nBut the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future\nprofits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,\nto invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to\nBonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and\nBonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after\nnext October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries\nto Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. \"Out\nhere, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an\nethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live\nup their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,\" Mosey\nsaid.\n, 2000 The Washington Post Company\n\n\n\n\n"}
