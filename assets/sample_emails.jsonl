Then it saw a better\ndeal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting\nunheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is\nselling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it\npays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.\nIt is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in\nenergy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even\noil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or\nnatural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large\nindustrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --\nwill free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they\nalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum\nand fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to\nconsumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.\n\"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know\nwhat they're going to use to grow crops with,\" said David Wyss, chief\neconomist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased\ntheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on\nan already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated\nthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a\ntypical U.S. household.\nThat and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher\nenergy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected\ngrowth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual\nrate in the first three months of next year. \"Overall, the recent energy\nprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic\nslowdown,\" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in\nSioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use\nnatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the\ncompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in\nDecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,\nwhich are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its\nexisting December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative\nofficer.\n\"We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' \" he said.\nTerra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but\nRosenbury said it would be \"substantial.\"  In coming months, Terra's good\nfortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the\nprices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even\npoint. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate\nthe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. \"If this persists,\"\nRosenbury said, \"it's going to be a real problem.\"\nHe estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18\nmillion tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating\nnow. \"Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that\nfarmers will not have as much as they want,\" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark\nInc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and\ndistributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,\nindefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next\nmonth. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify\ncontinued production. \"We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble\n[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to\nbuy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,\" said Paul\nM. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A\ncontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and\nraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to\nplant feed corn, he said. \"It's sticker shock.\"\nAccording to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas\nremains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --\nfarm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the\naluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the\nindustry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an\nanalyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.\nAluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,\nand December's production will be lower still, he said. \"We'll get more\nproduction cut announcements, I think,\" he said. A slowing in the U.S. and\nworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum\nsupplies. \"But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then\n[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more\nthan the current forecast,\" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question\nhow much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually\nentitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,\nsays spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville\nfor $550 a megawatt hour for December.\nBut the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future\nprofits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,\nto invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to\nBonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and\nBonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after\nnext October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries\nto Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. \"Out\nhere, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an\nethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live\nup their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,\" Mosey\nsaid.\n, 2000 The Washington Post Company\n\n\n\n\n"}

Then it saw a better\ndeal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting\nunheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is\nselling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it\npays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.\nIt is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in\nenergy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even\noil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or\nnatural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large\nindustrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --\nwill free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they\nalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum\nand fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to\nconsumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.\n\"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know\nwhat they're going to use to grow crops with,\" said David Wyss, chief\neconomist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased\ntheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on\nan already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated\nthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a\ntypical U.S. household.\nThat and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher\nenergy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected\ngrowth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual\nrate in the first three months of next year. \"Overall, the recent energy\nprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic\nslowdown,\" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in\nSioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use\nnatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the\ncompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in\nDecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,\nwhich are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its\nexisting December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative\nofficer.\n\"We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' \" he said.\nTerra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but\nRosenbury said it would be \"substantial.\"  In coming months, Terra's good\nfortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the\nprices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even\npoint. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate\nthe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. \"If this persists,\"\nRosenbury said, \"it's going to be a real problem.\"\nHe estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18\nmillion tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating\nnow. \"Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that\nfarmers will not have as much as they want,\" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark\nInc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and\ndistributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,\nindefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next\nmonth. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify\ncontinued production. \"We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble\n[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to\nbuy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,\" said Paul\nM. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A\ncontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and\nraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to\nplant feed corn, he said. \"It's sticker shock.\"\nAccording to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas\nremains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --\nfarm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the\naluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the\nindustry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an\nanalyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.\nAluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,\nand December's production will be lower still, he said. \"We'll get more\nproduction cut announcements, I think,\" he said.

I expect \nthese shippers to file the same types of comments in the new expansion.  FERC \nhas a policy prohibiting pipelines from selling more firm capacity than they \nhave at any point, so to the extent these shippers can show that Kern has \nindeed oversold Wheeler Ridge, I think that FERC will have to address their \nissue.  They surely don't want another El Paso on their hands.\n\nNGI's Daily Gas Price Index \npublished : March 21, 2001\nShippers Dispute Kern's Wheeler Ridge Sales\nChevron, Amoco Production, CanWest Gas Supply, Aera Energy and RME Petroleum \nhave called on FERC to stop Kern River Gas Transmission from overselling \ndelivery point rights at Wheeler Ridge into the Southern California Gas Co. \ndistribution system. The Firm Shippers said in comments filed this week that, \nin a situation strangely similar to the recent El Paso capacity reallocation \ncase, Kern River has oversold capacity at Wheeler Ridge, and its proposed \nexpansion project will only exacerbate the situation (Docket CP01-31). \nOn Nov. 15, 2000, Kern filed an application to expand its system and provide \n74,500 Dth/d of additional delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge into \nSoCal Gas. But Firm Shippers claim recent data provided by Kern and SoCal Gas \nindicates Kern River already has sold more than the 450 MMcf/d of firm \ndelivery point capacity it has available into Wheeler Ridge. Firm Shippers \ntold FERC. Kern River has sold 468.4 MMcf/d of capacity at Wheeler Ridge. \nNot true, says Lynn Dahlberg, Kern's manager of marketing. \"We have to date \nsubscribed at 450,000 dth/d. And unless we subscribe at more than 830,000 \ndth/d, we have not sold more capacity than SoCal has takeaway.\" The combined \nKern-Mojave lines can deliver on a firm basis 600,000 dth/d, with Kern having \n450,00 and Mojave 150,000. \"We can move more than that capacity, and we \nhave,\" she added. \nSoCal Gas has noted that it curtails nominations from Kern on a regular \nbasis, Shippers said. With the proposed expansion project, Kern will be \n\"creating the same type of firm delivery point over-sale situation that the \nCommission found to be unjust and unreasonable on El Paso Natural Gas at El \nPaso's SoCal Gas/Topock delivery point,\" they added. While they support the \nexpansion, they do not want to see their firm delivery rights in Southern \nCalifornia degraded. They also complained that Kern's marketing affiliate is \none of the primary beneficiaries of the proposed additional access to Wheeler \nRidge. \nDahlberg conceded that other interstate lines also deliver to the Wheeler \nRidge point, but \"adding more players to Wheeler gives markets on Socal more \nsupply options. Shippers have to compete.\" \nThe shippers are concerned, however that \"substantial benefits under the \ncurrently structured proposal accrue primarily to Kern River and its \naffiliate and would restrict the firm rights of existing shippers....\" The \nCommission should prohibit Kern from selling additional firm rights at \nWheeler Ridge, or provide only rights to secondary and tertiary capacity that \nis of a lower priority than the rights of existing firm customers, they said.

Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.\nHertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to \naddress \"the DWR contract problem\" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) \nkilling the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure \nfocused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not \ninclude Direct Access.\nChristian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any \n\"out clauses\" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract \nprovisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that \"outs\" for the \nstate are minimal or nonexistent.)\nIn addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might \nreform the contracts.\nAll this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear \nthat Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally \nabrogate anyone's contract rights.\nWe'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some \noptions that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the \ncore/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM \nPDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let \nme know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.\nThanks,\nJeff\n"}

The bill, AB 1,=20\nestablishes a new mechanism for purchasing power for the state=01,s busines=\nses=20\nand=20\nconsumers. Whether the mechanism works will depend chiefly on whether the=\n=20\nlimited revenue source used to pay for the power=01*collected by the state=\n=01,s=20\ninvestor-owned utilities (IOUs) under current retail rates=01*will cover=20\nwholesale=20\npower market costs incurred by the state. The law reflects the obsession by=\n=20\nCalifornia lawmakers with avoiding a rate increase rather than focusing on=\n=20\nthe=20\nunderlying flaws in California=01,s market structure.=20\nAB 1 ushers in several important changes to the California market structure=\n.=20\nIt=20\nalso contains several key provisions that capture the political mood in the=\n=20\nstate. Highlights of the bill include\n* Power buying authority transferred. The responsibility for purchasing pow=\ner=20\nfor the customers of California=01,s IOUs has been transferred to the Calif=\nornia=20\nDepartment of Water Resources (CDWR). The California utilities will continu=\ne=20\nto=20\noperate and schedule their remaining generating facilities and contracts. T=\nhe=20\ndifference between the utilities=01, total load and the sum of their resour=\nces=20\n(referred to as the utilities=01, =01&net short=018 amount) will be supplie=\nd by CDWR,=20\nan=20\namount of energy that varies between 5,000 and 25,000 megawatts (MW),=20\ndepending=20\non the time of year, time of day, and utility plant availability. The=20\nutilities=20\nmost recently performed this function themselves, buying energy from the=20\nCalifornia Power Exchange (PX). However, CDWR has been buying electricity o=\nn=20\nbehalf of the IOUs since mid-January, when the near-bankruptcy of Southern=\n=20\nCalifornia Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) threatened to=20\ndisrupt=20\nsupplies to their customers. CDWR is a state agency that manages water=20\nreservoirs and transportation systems in the state. CDWR uses an enormous=\n=20\namount of electricity to transport water across California and provides=20\ncritical load-shedding capability to the independent system operator (ISO).=\n=20\nIn=20\naddition, CDWR=01,s reservoirs generate power. The CDWR is thus well integr=\nated=20\nin=20\nthe state=01,s electric grid but in the past has not executed large, compli=\ncated=20\nenergy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of California=01,s=20\nutilities.=20\n* Portfolio of transactions. The intent of AB 1 is to allow CDWR to execute=\n a=20\nportfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and=\n=20\ntheir customers. CDWR has until January 2, 2003, to execute contracts. CDWR=\n=20\nwill take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse.=\n=20\nIt=20\nhas issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms, including=20\nmonthly,=20\nannual, two-year, three-year, and longer. CDWR may also enter into options.=\n=20\nThus, although CDWR=01,s role is intended to be temporary, the contracts th=\nat it=20\nexecutes could extend many years.\n* Power for munis. CDWR may purchase power on behalf of some California=20\nmunicipal utilities at the municipal utilities=01, election.\n* New payment scheme. CDWR will be entitled to a portion of existing utilit=\ny=20\nrates to pay for the cost of purchased power, interest on bonds, and=20\nadministrative expenses. This payment stream will be equal to the differenc=\ne=20\nbetween the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates=\n=20\n(averaging about $0.07 per kilowatt-hour &#91;kWh&#93;) and the utilities=\n=01,=20\ncosts to run=20\ntheir own generation plants, costs of bilateral and qualifying facility=20\ncontracts, and the costs of ancillary services. The CDWR share of retail=20\nrates=20\nis referred to as the California Purchase Adjustment (CPA). It is not clear=\n=20\nwhether the CPA will cover wholesale power market costs. Current prices for=\n=20\nmultiyear power contracts may lie above the CPA. In addition, if investors=\n=20\nbelieve that the CPA is inadequate to cover costs, the entire program may b=\ne=20\nabandoned.=20\n* New bonds. Bonds will be issued to secure power. The total amount of bond=\ns=20\nissued may not exceed four times the CPA. The state will transfer $500=20\nmillion=20\nfrom the general fund to jump-start the program, which begins immediately.=\n=20\nThis=20\nseed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by CDWR from the=20\nCalifornia=20\nutilities=01, customers (and municipal utilities if they opt in).\n* New residential rate freeze. The California Public Utilities Commission=\n=20\n(CPUC) is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it ha=\ns=20\ncompleted paying all outstanding obligations. This locks in the recent 9=20\npercent residential rate increase indefinitely. Governor Gray Davis thus=20\nkeeps=20\nhis pledge not to increase rates further.\n* Retail competition. To help secure a stable payment stream for the new=20\nbonds,=20\nAB 1 enables the CPUC to prohibit the utilities=01, retail customers from=\n=20\nchoosing=20\nan alternative electricity provider until CDWR=01,s obligations are paid.=\n=20\nAlthough=20\nthe CPUC has yet to act on this, the action would effectively halt the=20\ncompetitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the CDWR progra=\nm.=20\n* Taxpayer protection. AB 1 directs that the new bonds clearly state =01&&#=\n91;\nn&#93;either=20\nthe faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of California is=20\npledged=20\nto the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond.=018 Thus, the =\nbonds=20\nare secured only by the payment stream from utility rates.\n*No assets affected. The CDWR is granted neither ownership nor control of=\n=20\nutility assets.\nIronically, the authority now granted CDWR is what California utilities had=\n=20\nessentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity=\n=20\nprices by executing a portfolio of transactions. The utilities were never=\n=20\nprovided sufficient authority to execute term contracts. In addition, the=\n=20\nutilities have more experience to perform this function than CDWR.=20\nRather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices,=20\nCalifornia=20\nhas sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing=\n=20\nfunction. SCE and PG&E are still left to contend with uncollected costs fro=\nm=20\npast energy purchases, although they will no longer incur costs associated=\n=20\nwith=20\nbuying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail=\n=20\nrates. The utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved.=20\nIt is not clear whether the law=01,s prohibition on rate increases for=20\nresidential=20\ncustomers can be achieved. The law is silent on rate increases for commerci=\nal=20\nand industrial customers, providing a potential path for recovering=20\nhigher-than-\nexpected costs. Alternatively, CDWR could conceivably find contracts of=20\nsufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met. These=\n=20\ncontracts would lock in today=01,s retail rates for a long period of time.=\n=20\nAB 1 is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the=20\npower=20\nsystem in California to a more stable footing. Key tasks remain.\n* California=01,s wholesale market structure, which helped cause the supply=\n=20\ncrisis=20\nby ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in=\n=20\nCalifornia, remains unchanged. The term contracts CDWR is likely to sign wi=\nll=20\nprovide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will=\n=20\nnot=20\nbe sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities. In=20\naddition,=20\nCalifornia=01,s siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged.\n* The state must still address the need to expedite the development of new=\n=20\npower plants.\n* AB 1 does not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale ener=\ngy=20\ncosts of California=01,s utilities. The state has been negotiating a deal w=\nith=20\nthe=20\nutilities that may involve the transfer of generation or transmission asset=\ns=20\nto=20\nthe state. However, the utilities have achieved recent court victories that=\n=20\nmay=20\npave the way to a court-directed recovery of these costs. Recent audits=20\nindicate that SCE and PG&E recovered their stranded costs early in 2000,=20\nwhich=20\nshould have triggered an end to their respective rate freezes. A legal=20\nshowdown=20\nbetween the utilities and the state on this issue may be inevitable.\n**end**\nFollow above URL for full report.\n*********************************************************\nCome Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek2001, \"Shooting the Rapids:=20\nStrategies and Risks for the Energy Future\" in Houston, February 12-16,=20\n2001! =20\nFor more information and to register, please visit=20\nhttp://www20.cera.com/ceraweek/\n*********************************************************\n\nE-mail Category: Alert                                            =20\nCERA Knowledge Area(s): Western Energy,=20\n**********************************************************************\nTo make changes to your cera.com account go to:\nhttp://www20.cera.com/client/updateaccount\nForgot your username and password?

{"from": "Mike D Smith", "to": "Phillip K Allen", "content": "SCE's motion for preliminary injunction seeking an order permitting \nrecoupment of past and future undercollections was denied today.   It appears \nthat the case will now be scheduled for a future hearing after the parties \nhave had a chance to develop any relevant facts and fully brief the legal \nissues.  \nBelow is a summary of what occurred today: \n________________________________________________\n     Motion for Preliminary Injunction:  The Court denied SCE's Motion for a \nPreliminary Injunction on the merits.  Judge Lew stated that the Motion was \n\"wholly inappropriate\" and that granting it would violate the 11th \nAmendment.  The Court stated that mandatory injunctions, such as the one \nrequested here, are \"strongly disfavored\" and involve a heightened standard \nthat SCE failed to meet.  The Court also said it was constrained by the \nmatters put at issue in the pleadings, and that here the Motion sought relief \nin excess of that requested in the complaint.\n     While the Court let defense counsel argue for about 15-30 minutes, he \nmostly appeared disinterested in what they were saying.  Plaintiff's counsel \ndid not make any oral argument.\n    The Court also said that this case turns on the Pike County exception, \nwhich depends on whether there were alternative markets available; and that \nif the exception applies, there is no preemption claim.  The Court said that \nthere were certain narrow issues before it which is all that it will address, \nand that the Court is not a \"do it all\" problem solver for the parties.  The \nCourt did not indicate whether it was predisposed to rule for any side.\n     Motion for Order Specifying Facts without Substantial Controversy:  The \nCourt granted the motion as to facts 1-10, 12, and denied it as to facts 1, \n13.  The Court found that these particular facts were not substantially \ndisputed by the defendants, and that further discovery was not needed for the \nCourt to determine them. (Since I do not have a copy of the filings, I am \nunable to provide further comment.  Please let me know if you want me to \nobtain copies of the filings.)\n     Motions to Intervene:  The Court granted the Motions to Intervene \n(permissive intervention) filed by Los Angeles County and the Utility Reform \nNetwork on the ground that their participation would assist the court in \nhearing the complex matters presented.\n     Motion to Specially Appear:  The Court denied the California Attorney \nGeneral's motion to \"specially appear\" as inappropriate, but without \nprejudice to filing a motion for permissive intervention.\n     Criticism of Counsel:   The Judge castigated SCE's counsel in several \ninstances.  He called the preliminary injunction motion \"wholly \ninappropriate.\"  He criticized SCE's description in briefs of his ruling on \nJanuary 8, 2001, which the Judge said was \"flatly wrong.\"  (He said his \nJanuary 8 order did not hold that the filed rate doctrine permits the \nplaintiff to recover recoupment costs.)  With respect to the Motion for Order \nSpecifying Facts, he said he was \"not fooled\" by SCE's \"creative arguments.\"  \nThe Court also gave a general admonishment about \"spinning\" his rulings \noutside of the courtroom.  Reading between the lines, the Judge seemed \nbothered by media reports.  I do not know if the Judge was aware, but SCE had \na public relations person mingling in the court room with the many reporters \npresent.\n     Calendar:  The Court advanced the March 19, 2001 Scheduling Conference \nto March 5 at 9:00.  The Conference will address matters including discovery \npractice, motion deadlines and the trial date.  The Judge said he would \nconsider SCE's request for an early trial date.  However, he also said that \nit appeared that the primary disputed issues were legal, not factual, and \ntherefore he expected that summary judgment motions would be filed by both \nsides.\n     Consolidation with PG&E matter:  The Court initially expressed concern \nthat the PG&E case was transferred from Northern California, saying he had \ndoubts that this was the proper venue.  Later, however, the Judge seemed \nplacated when PG&E's counsel told him that the company had substantial assets \nin this district.  One counsel also told the Court that the parties had \nstipulated to consolidate the PG&E matter with the SCE matter, though the \nCourt did not say whether he would order consolidation.\n    Impression of Judge:  This was my first time observing Judge Lew.  He \nseems extremely strict, straightforward and no-nonsense.  He seemed very well \nprepared on the substance and not at all shy about ruling on the merits.  In \nthe SCE matter and preceding non-related matters, the Judge frequently \ncut-off counsel's arguments to focus on narrow issues of law, and made \ncounsel either answer very specific questions or stop talking completely.  \nHere, the Judge acknowledged this case's importance and said he does not take \nthis matter lightly.\n"}

{"from": "Rebecca W Cantrell", "to": "Phillip K Allen", "content": "Per our discussions last week about the Kern River open season.  I expect \nthese shippers to file the same types of comments in the new expansion.  FERC \nhas a policy prohibiting pipelines from selling more firm capacity than they \nhave at any point, so to the extent these shippers can show that Kern has \nindeed oversold Wheeler Ridge, I think that FERC will have to address their \nissue.  They surely don't want another El Paso on their hands.\n\nNGI's Daily Gas Price Index \npublished : March 21, 2001\nShippers Dispute Kern's Wheeler Ridge Sales\nChevron, Amoco Production, CanWest Gas Supply, Aera Energy and RME Petroleum \nhave called on FERC to stop Kern River Gas Transmission from overselling \ndelivery point rights at Wheeler Ridge into the Southern California Gas Co. \ndistribution system. The Firm Shippers said in comments filed this week that, \nin a situation strangely similar to the recent El Paso capacity reallocation \ncase, Kern River has oversold capacity at Wheeler Ridge, and its proposed \nexpansion project will only exacerbate the situation (Docket CP01-31). \nOn Nov. 15, 2000, Kern filed an application to expand its system and provide \n74,500 Dth/d of additional delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge into \nSoCal Gas. But Firm Shippers claim recent data provided by Kern and SoCal Gas \nindicates Kern River already has sold more than the 450 MMcf/d of firm \ndelivery point capacity it has available into Wheeler Ridge. Firm Shippers \ntold FERC. Kern River has sold 468.4 MMcf/d of capacity at Wheeler Ridge. \nNot true, says Lynn Dahlberg, Kern's manager of marketing. \"We have to date \nsubscribed at 450,000 dth/d. And unless we subscribe at more than 830,000 \ndth/d, we have not sold more capacity than SoCal has takeaway.\" The combined \nKern-Mojave lines can deliver on a firm basis 600,000 dth/d, with Kern having \n450,00 and Mojave 150,000. \"We can move more than that capacity, and we \nhave,\" she added. \nSoCal Gas has noted that it curtails nominations from Kern on a regular \nbasis, Shippers said. With the proposed expansion project, Kern will be \n\"creating the same type of firm delivery point over-sale situation that the \nCommission found to be unjust and unreasonable on El Paso Natural Gas at El \nPaso's SoCal Gas/Topock delivery point,\" they added. While they support the \nexpansion, they do not want to see their firm delivery rights in Southern \nCalifornia degraded. They also complained that Kern's marketing affiliate is \none of the primary beneficiaries of the proposed additional access to Wheeler \nRidge. \nDahlberg conceded that other interstate lines also deliver to the Wheeler \nRidge point, but \"adding more players to Wheeler gives markets on Socal more \nsupply options. Shippers have to compete.\" \nThe shippers are concerned, however that \"substantial benefits under the \ncurrently structured proposal accrue primarily to Kern River and its \naffiliate and would restrict the firm rights of existing shippers....\" The \nCommission should prohibit Kern from selling additional firm rights at \nWheeler Ridge, or provide only rights to secondary and tertiary capacity that \nis of a lower priority than the rights of existing firm customers, they said.

{"from": "Mike D Smith", "to": "Phillip K Allen", "content": "SCE's motion for preliminary injunction seeking an order permitting \nrecoupment of past and future undercollections was denied today.   It appears \nthat the case will now be scheduled for a future hearing after the parties \nhave had a chance to develop any relevant facts and fully brief the legal \nissues.  \nBelow is a summary of what occurred today: \n________________________________________________\n     Motion for Preliminary Injunction:  The Court denied SCE's Motion for a \nPreliminary Injunction on the merits.  Judge Lew stated that the Motion was \n\"wholly inappropriate\" and that granting it would violate the 11th \nAmendment.  The Court stated that mandatory injunctions, such as the one \nrequested here, are \"strongly disfavored\" and involve a heightened standard \nthat SCE failed to meet.  The Court also said it was constrained by the \nmatters put at issue in the pleadings, and that here the Motion sought relief \nin excess of that requested in the complaint.\n     While the Court let defense counsel argue for about 15-30 minutes, he \nmostly appeared disinterested in what they were saying.  Plaintiff's counsel \ndid not make any oral argument.\n    The Court also said that this case turns on the Pike County exception, \nwhich depends on whether there were alternative markets available; and that \nif the exception applies, there is no preemption claim.  The Court said that \nthere were certain narrow issues before it which is all that it will address, \nand that the Court is not a \"do it all\" problem solver for the parties.  The \nCourt did not indicate whether it was predisposed to rule for any side.\n     Motion for Order Specifying Facts without Substantial Controversy:  The \nCourt granted the motion as to facts 1-10, 12, and denied it as to facts 1, \n13.  The Court found that these particular facts were not substantially \ndisputed by the defendants, and that further discovery was not needed for the \nCourt to determine them. (Since I do not have a copy of the filings, I am \nunable to provide further comment.  Please let me know if you want me to \nobtain copies of the filings.)\n     Motions to Intervene:  The Court granted the Motions to Intervene \n(permissive intervention) filed by Los Angeles County and the Utility Reform \nNetwork on the ground that their participation would assist the court in \nhearing the complex matters presented.\n     Motion to Specially Appear:  The Court denied the California Attorney \nGeneral's motion to \"specially appear\" as inappropriate, but without \nprejudice to filing a motion for permissive intervention.\n     Criticism of Counsel:   The Judge castigated SCE's counsel in several \ninstances.  He called the preliminary injunction motion \"wholly \ninappropriate.\"  He criticized SCE's description in briefs of his ruling on \nJanuary 8, 2001, which the Judge said was \"flatly wrong.\"  (He said his \nJanuary 8 order did not hold that the filed rate doctrine permits the \nplaintiff to recover recoupment costs.)  With respect to the Motion for Order \nSpecifying Facts, he said he was \"not fooled\" by SCE's \"creative arguments.\"  \nThe Court also gave a general admonishment about \"spinning\" his rulings \noutside of the courtroom.  Reading between the lines, the Judge seemed \nbothered by media reports.  I do not know if the Judge was aware, but SCE had \na public relations person mingling in the court room with the many reporters \npresent.\n     Calendar:  The Court advanced the March 19, 2001 Scheduling Conference \nto March 5 at 9:00.  The Conference will address matters including discovery \npractice, motion deadlines and the trial date.  The Judge said he would \nconsider SCE's request for an early trial date.  However, he also said that \nit appeared that the primary disputed issues were legal, not factual, and \ntherefore he expected that summary judgment motions would be filed by both \nsides.\n     Consolidation with PG&E matter:  The Court initially expressed concern \nthat the PG&E case was transferred from Northern California, saying he had \ndoubts that this was the proper venue.  Later, however, the Judge seemed \nplacated when PG&E's counsel told him that the company had substantial assets \nin this district.  One counsel also told the Court that the parties had \nstipulated to consolidate the PG&E matter with the SCE matter, though the \nCourt did not say whether he would order consolidation.\n    Impression of Judge:  This was my first time observing Judge Lew.  He \nseems extremely strict, straightforward and no-nonsense.  He seemed very well \nprepared on the substance and not at all shy about ruling on the merits.  In \nthe SCE matter and preceding non-related matters, the Judge frequently \ncut-off counsel's arguments to focus on narrow issues of law, and made \ncounsel either answer very specific questions or stop talking completely.  \nHere, the Judge acknowledged this case's importance and said he does not take \nthis matter lightly.\n"}

The bill, AB 1,=20\nestablishes a new mechanism for purchasing power for the state=01,s busines=\nses=20\nand=20\nconsumers. Whether the mechanism works will depend chiefly on whether the=\n=20\nlimited revenue source used to pay for the power=01*collected by the state=\n=01,s=20\ninvestor-owned utilities (IOUs) under current retail rates=01*will cover=20\nwholesale=20\npower market costs incurred by the state. The law reflects the obsession by=\n=20\nCalifornia lawmakers with avoiding a rate increase rather than focusing on=\n=20\nthe=20\nunderlying flaws in California=01,s market structure.=20\nAB 1 ushers in several important changes to the California market structure=\n.=20\nIt=20\nalso contains several key provisions that capture the political mood in the=\n=20\nstate. Highlights of the bill include\n* Power buying authority transferred. The responsibility for purchasing pow=\ner=20\nfor the customers of California=01,s IOUs has been transferred to the Calif=\nornia=20\nDepartment of Water Resources (CDWR). The California utilities will continu=\ne=20\nto=20\noperate and schedule their remaining generating facilities and contracts. T=\nhe=20\ndifference between the utilities=01, total load and the sum of their resour=\nces=20\n(referred to as the utilities=01, =01&net short=018 amount) will be supplie=\nd by CDWR,=20\nan=20\namount of energy that varies between 5,000 and 25,000 megawatts (MW),=20\ndepending=20\non the time of year, time of day, and utility plant availability. The=20\nutilities=20\nmost recently performed this function themselves, buying energy from the=20\nCalifornia Power Exchange (PX). However, CDWR has been buying electricity o=\nn=20\nbehalf of the IOUs since mid-January, when the near-bankruptcy of Southern=\n=20\nCalifornia Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) threatened to=20\ndisrupt=20\nsupplies to their customers. CDWR is a state agency that manages water=20\nreservoirs and transportation systems in the state. CDWR uses an enormous=\n=20\namount of electricity to transport water across California and provides=20\ncritical load-shedding capability to the independent system operator (ISO).=\n=20\nIn=20\naddition, CDWR=01,s reservoirs generate power. The CDWR is thus well integr=\nated=20\nin=20\nthe state=01,s electric grid but in the past has not executed large, compli=\ncated=20\nenergy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of California=01,s=20\nutilities.=20\n* Portfolio of transactions. The intent of AB 1 is to allow CDWR to execute=\n a=20\nportfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and=\n=20\ntheir customers. CDWR has until January 2, 2003, to execute contracts. CDWR=\n=20\nwill take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse.=\n=20\nIt=20\nhas issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms, including=20\nmonthly,=20\nannual, two-year, three-year, and longer. CDWR may also enter into options.=\n=20\nThus, although CDWR=01,s role is intended to be temporary, the contracts th=\nat it=20\nexecutes could extend many years.\n* Power for munis. CDWR may purchase power on behalf of some California=20\nmunicipal utilities at the municipal utilities=01, election.\n* New payment scheme. CDWR will be entitled to a portion of existing utilit=\ny=20\nrates to pay for the cost of purchased power, interest on bonds, and=20\nadministrative expenses. This payment stream will be equal to the differenc=\ne=20\nbetween the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates=\n=20\n(averaging about $0.07 per kilowatt-hour &#91;kWh&#93;) and the utilities=\n=01,=20\ncosts to run=20\ntheir own generation plants, costs of bilateral and qualifying facility=20\ncontracts, and the costs of ancillary services. The CDWR share of retail=20\nrates=20\nis referred to as the California Purchase Adjustment (CPA). It is not clear=\n=20\nwhether the CPA will cover wholesale power market costs. Current prices for=\n=20\nmultiyear power contracts may lie above the CPA. In addition, if investors=\n=20\nbelieve that the CPA is inadequate to cover costs, the entire program may b=\ne=20\nabandoned.=20\n* New bonds. Bonds will be issued to secure power. The total amount of bond=\ns=20\nissued may not exceed four times the CPA. The state will transfer $500=20\nmillion=20\nfrom the general fund to jump-start the program, which begins immediately.=\n=20\nThis=20\nseed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by CDWR from the=20\nCalifornia=20\nutilities=01, customers (and municipal utilities if they opt in).\n* New residential rate freeze. The California Public Utilities Commission=\n=20\n(CPUC) is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it ha=\ns=20\ncompleted paying all outstanding obligations. This locks in the recent 9=20\npercent residential rate increase indefinitely. Governor Gray Davis thus=20\nkeeps=20\nhis pledge not to increase rates further.\n* Retail competition. To help secure a stable payment stream for the new=20\nbonds,=20\nAB 1 enables the CPUC to prohibit the utilities=01, retail customers from=\n=20\nchoosing=20\nan alternative electricity provider until CDWR=01,s obligations are paid.=\n=20\nAlthough=20\nthe CPUC has yet to act on this, the action would effectively halt the=20\ncompetitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the CDWR progra=\nm.=20\n* Taxpayer protection. AB 1 directs that the new bonds clearly state =01&&#=\n91;\nn&#93;either=20\nthe faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of California is=20\npledged=20\nto the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond.=018 Thus, the =\nbonds=20\nare secured only by the payment stream from utility rates.\n*No assets affected. The CDWR is granted neither ownership nor control of=\n=20\nutility assets.\nIronically, the authority now granted CDWR is what California utilities had=\n=20\nessentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity=\n=20\nprices by executing a portfolio of transactions. The utilities were never=\n=20\nprovided sufficient authority to execute term contracts. In addition, the=\n=20\nutilities have more experience to perform this function than CDWR.=20\nRather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices,=20\nCalifornia=20\nhas sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing=\n=20\nfunction. SCE and PG&E are still left to contend with uncollected costs fro=\nm=20\npast energy purchases, although they will no longer incur costs associated=\n=20\nwith=20\nbuying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail=\n=20\nrates. The utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved.=20\nIt is not clear whether the law=01,s prohibition on rate increases for=20\nresidential=20\ncustomers can be achieved. The law is silent on rate increases for commerci=\nal=20\nand industrial customers, providing a potential path for recovering=20\nhigher-than-\nexpected costs. Alternatively, CDWR could conceivably find contracts of=20\nsufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met. These=\n=20\ncontracts would lock in today=01,s retail rates for a long period of time.=\n=20\nAB 1 is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the=20\npower=20\nsystem in California to a more stable footing. Key tasks remain.\n* California=01,s wholesale market structure, which helped cause the supply=\n=20\ncrisis=20\nby ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in=\n=20\nCalifornia, remains unchanged. The term contracts CDWR is likely to sign wi=\nll=20\nprovide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will=\n=20\nnot=20\nbe sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities. In=20\naddition,=20\nCalifornia=01,s siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged.\n* The state must still address the need to expedite the development of new=\n=20\npower plants.\n* AB 1 does not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale ener=\ngy=20\ncosts of California=01,s utilities. The state has been negotiating a deal w=\nith=20\nthe=20\nutilities that may involve the transfer of generation or transmission asset=\ns=20\nto=20\nthe state. However, the utilities have achieved recent court victories that=\n=20\nmay=20\npave the way to a court-directed recovery of these costs. Recent audits=20\nindicate that SCE and PG&E recovered their stranded costs early in 2000,=20\nwhich=20\nshould have triggered an end to their respective rate freezes. A legal=20\nshowdown=20\nbetween the utilities and the state on this issue may be inevitable.\n**end**\nFollow above URL for full report.\n*********************************************************\nCome Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek2001, \"Shooting the Rapids:=20\nStrategies and Risks for the Energy Future\" in Houston, February 12-16,=20\n2001! =20\nFor more information and to register, please visit=20\nhttp://www20.cera.com/ceraweek/\n*********************************************************\n\nE-mail Category: Alert                                            =20\nCERA Knowledge Area(s): Western Energy,=20\n**********************************************************************\nTo make changes to your cera.com account go to:\nhttp://www20.cera.com/client/updateaccount\nForgot your username and password?

Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.\nHertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to \naddress \"the DWR contract problem\" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) \nkilling the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure \nfocused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not \ninclude Direct Access.\nChristian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any \n\"out clauses\" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract \nprovisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that \"outs\" for the \nstate are minimal or nonexistent.)\nIn addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might \nreform the contracts.\nAll this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear \nthat Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally \nabrogate anyone's contract rights.\nWe'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some \noptions that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the \ncore/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM \nPDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let \nme know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.\nThanks,\nJeff\n"}

We have informally addressed Jan's performance issues with her, \nand next week intend to formalize that also.  That Jan makes more than anyone \nelse in the group makes her situation quite critical in my eyes, because we \nare not getting a return on that investment.\nThe rest of the group is paid based on lots of factors that you are already \naware of, years of service, years in scheduling, level of performance, etc.  \nIn Stacey's particular case, I am recommending her for promotion at the end \nof the year, which will bump her pay scale up and make her pay more equitable \nwith her job performance.  Also, I intend to help smooth over other \ninequities through the bonus pool.\nIn regards to Patti, I have recommended her for a bonus for her service \nduring the rough time we've had when we were understaffed.  Bob Superty has \nsupported this, and the information you provided him this last week should \nhelp in that endeavour.  Patti has had her pay increased this year after a \nsalary survey was performed by our HR group.  I would like to point out that \nPatti is pretty well paid for someone with her experience level.  Also, Patti \nwould move up in the pay scale if she is promoted to Manager.  I am not sure \nwhat the exact plan is for Patti and myself as far as how that will go.  I \nwould like to say that I feel more comfortable being back as each day goes \non, and am ready to make a move to trading anytime now if that is what you \nand Mike still want to do.  \nAs regards to the new hires:  yes, we can hire more like these at these \nprices.  We would love to have employees like Matt, and Ted and Shelly, \nespecially at these prices.  Patti did an excellent job hiring these \nindividuals.  We have already started the process of looking for more like \nthese to start backfilling in for Hillary and Jan.  We also need to hire more \nfor establishing a bigger physical presence in the west.  We probably need to \nsit down and go over with you and Mike as to what kind of plans you have for \nexpanding the desk.  \nFinally, I would like to bring up that Lucci has requested that the Denver \noffice do all nominations for IM Denver deals.

Do you have any comments?\n\nI've talked with several people familar with gas sales and distribution in\nthe southwestern portion of the US.  Summarized below is their collective\nresponse:\n     1.   The pipeline capacity is limited due to an order by the Federal\nEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and FERC has jurisdiction over the\ninterstate sale and distribution of natural gas.  The Department of\nTransportation has jursidiction only over certain safety issues resulting\nfrom the gas explosion.\n     2.   The spot market has risen in the Arizona area -- currently it is\nat $  17.11__ for 30-day _Jan'01__.  The reason prices are high is due to the\nexcessive demand in California for natural gas for its power plants.  Thus,\ngas is flowing into California -- the only way gas will flow east away from\nCalifornia is in response to higher prices.\n     3.   Enron is not \"holding back supplies to the area\".  Enron is not a\nproducer of natural gas, does not have ANY physical supplies, and does not\nhave or utilize storage capacity in this area.  Also, Enron controls\npipeline capacity over the El Paso Gas Pipeline of only 80,000 cf per day\n-- this pipeline has a capacity of 4 BILLION cf per day (at full capacity).\nThe dominant holder of capacity on this pipleline is a gas marketing\nsubsidiary of El Paso Gas.  Moreover, there are numerous marketers of\nnatural gas in the area, ensuring competition and pricing visibility and\nliquidity.  Thus, there is no way that Enron could control or influence the\nprice of physical suppliles in the area.\n     4.   Gas trading generally occurs over monthly or seasonal (e.g.,\nwinter) periods, not annual periods.  And, the winter season for which\nmarketers generally quote prices is considered to be November to March (not\non December 1 as the note below suggests).\n     5.   Finally, Enron would not want to hold back physical supplies to\nthe area.  Enron is primarily a trader of natural gas, engaged in the\nbuying and selling of the non-physical and financial side of natural gas\nsupplies.  Through Enron On Line, Enron is both a seller AND a buyer,\nmaking margins on trades of positions in natural gas.   Thus, Enron would\nbe disadvantaged by not selling gas positions, even if it could hold back\nphysical supplies to the area, because it is not engaged in buying and\nselling of positions in natural gas.\n\n\n\n\n\"Lowe, Carol\" <CPLowe@NationalGypsum.com> on 11/30/2000 04:46:56 PM\nTo:   \"Richard D.

Do you have any comments?\n\nI've talked with several people familar with gas sales and distribution in\nthe southwestern portion of the US.  Summarized below is their collective\nresponse:\n     1.   The pipeline capacity is limited due to an order by the Federal\nEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and FERC has jurisdiction over the\ninterstate sale and distribution of natural gas.  The Department of\nTransportation has jursidiction only over certain safety issues resulting\nfrom the gas explosion.\n     2.   The spot market has risen in the Arizona area -- currently it is\nat $  17.11__ for 30-day _Jan'01__.  The reason prices are high is due to the\nexcessive demand in California for natural gas for its power plants.  Thus,\ngas is flowing into California -- the only way gas will flow east away from\nCalifornia is in response to higher prices.\n     3.   Enron is not \"holding back supplies to the area\".  Enron is not a\nproducer of natural gas, does not have ANY physical supplies, and does not\nhave or utilize storage capacity in this area.  Also, Enron controls\npipeline capacity over the El Paso Gas Pipeline of only 80,000 cf per day\n-- this pipeline has a capacity of 4 BILLION cf per day (at full capacity).\nThe dominant holder of capacity on this pipleline is a gas marketing\nsubsidiary of El Paso Gas.  Moreover, there are numerous marketers of\nnatural gas in the area, ensuring competition and pricing visibility and\nliquidity.  Thus, there is no way that Enron could control or influence the\nprice of physical suppliles in the area.\n     4.   Gas trading generally occurs over monthly or seasonal (e.g.,\nwinter) periods, not annual periods.  And, the winter season for which\nmarketers generally quote prices is considered to be November to March (not\non December 1 as the note below suggests).\n     5.   Finally, Enron would not want to hold back physical supplies to\nthe area.  Enron is primarily a trader of natural gas, engaged in the\nbuying and selling of the non-physical and financial side of natural gas\nsupplies.  Through Enron On Line, Enron is both a seller AND a buyer,\nmaking margins on trades of positions in natural gas.   Thus, Enron would\nbe disadvantaged by not selling gas positions, even if it could hold back\nphysical supplies to the area, because it is not engaged in buying and\nselling of positions in natural gas.\n\n\n\n\n\"Lowe, Carol\" <CPLowe@NationalGypsum.com> on 11/30/2000 04:46:56 PM\nTo:   \"Richard D.

{"from": "Randall L Gay", "to": "Phillip K Allen", "content": "Phillip:  I agree with your conclusions, and we have already started \naddressing most of these issues.  \nFirst of all, I would like to say that all of the schedulers are performing \nat a high level, except for Hillary and Jan.  We have formally addressed \nHillary's performance problems, and he is on  a schedule for improvement or \nhe is out.  We have informally addressed Jan's performance issues with her, \nand next week intend to formalize that also.  That Jan makes more than anyone \nelse in the group makes her situation quite critical in my eyes, because we \nare not getting a return on that investment.\nThe rest of the group is paid based on lots of factors that you are already \naware of, years of service, years in scheduling, level of performance, etc.  \nIn Stacey's particular case, I am recommending her for promotion at the end \nof the year, which will bump her pay scale up and make her pay more equitable \nwith her job performance.  Also, I intend to help smooth over other \ninequities through the bonus pool.\nIn regards to Patti, I have recommended her for a bonus for her service \nduring the rough time we've had when we were understaffed.  Bob Superty has \nsupported this, and the information you provided him this last week should \nhelp in that endeavour.  Patti has had her pay increased this year after a \nsalary survey was performed by our HR group.  I would like to point out that \nPatti is pretty well paid for someone with her experience level.  Also, Patti \nwould move up in the pay scale if she is promoted to Manager.  I am not sure \nwhat the exact plan is for Patti and myself as far as how that will go.  I \nwould like to say that I feel more comfortable being back as each day goes \non, and am ready to make a move to trading anytime now if that is what you \nand Mike still want to do.  \nAs regards to the new hires:  yes, we can hire more like these at these \nprices.  We would love to have employees like Matt, and Ted and Shelly, \nespecially at these prices.  Patti did an excellent job hiring these \nindividuals.  We have already started the process of looking for more like \nthese to start backfilling in for Hillary and Jan.  We also need to hire more \nfor establishing a bigger physical presence in the west.  We probably need to \nsit down and go over with you and Mike as to what kind of plans you have for \nexpanding the desk.  \nFinally, I would like to bring up that Lucci has requested that the Denver \noffice do all nominations for IM Denver deals.  This has met stiff resistance \nin the past, and I do not know how ya'll feel about it, but I promised that I \nwould bring it up. I personally feel that Denver and CIG would be isolated \nfrom us if the operations were to move to Denver.  \nIf you have additional questions or comments please let me know.  Thanks.  \n\n"}

{"from": "Kristin Walsh", "to": "Phillip K Allen", "content": "Executive Summary:\n? BC's NDP Leader Publicly Concedes Defeat to Liberals\n? BPA seeks Federal Loan for Improvements, Future Fish Credits Limited  \n? Washington House Extends Aluminum Smelters' Power Re-Sale Rights by 1,500 \nMWs \nBC Elections\nAccording to our information, the BC government is preparing for the Liberal \ntake this week.  The election is slated for 16 May 2001 and it appears likely \nthat we are looking at a near Liberal sweep -- they are currently leading 41% \nto 25% at the polls.  There is about a three-week lead time between the \ngeneral election on May 16th, the Final Count on May 29th, and the Return Day \non June 7th -- so there will be a period of jockeying around some issues.  \nThe New Democratic Party (NDP) leader, Ujjal Dosanjh, has effectively \nconceded the election in a public announcement.  Dosanjh is making public \npleas to voters not to desert the NDP in favor of the Greens so that the NDP \ncan retain official party status (4 seats).  Dosanjh has stated that he \"will \nbe happy if the NDP gets 10 to 15 seats.\"\nThe following are likely to be the key energy policy officials once the \nLiberal Party takes power in BC:\n? Richard Neufeld, Minister of Energy, Mines and Northern Development \n(replacing NDP Minister Glenn Robertson)\n? Dan Jarvis, Deputy critic on Energy, Mines and Northern Development Murray \nCoell, Minister of Environment, Lands and Parks (replacing Ian Waddell) \n? John Van Dongen, Fisheries Neufeld, Jarvis, Coell and Van Dongen are \ncurrently Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs).\nWhile Gordon Campbell, the probable incoming premier, will have been \neffectively muzzled in the interim when it comes to talk about energy \nderegulation, the opposition will likely have plenty to say about it.  The \npeople we'll need to be looking at this regard are:  Glenn Robertson - \nMinister of Energy and Mines, and Ian Waddell - Minister of Environment, Land \n& Parks.  \nIt appears certain that the Liberals will move to privatize at least some of \nthe power crown corporations almost immediately.  They have promised a \nbalanced budget and a chunk of  money to do it their way; they have made \ncampaign promises about privatization to stir the economy; and they have \ntight back channels with the crown corporations' management who want \"a \nstraight privatization plan instead of coop approach to deregulation.\"  \nSources report that, if elected, the Liberals promise a referendum on land \nclaims treaties with the local native Indians (or \"First Nations\").  These \ntreaties result from overlapping claims to land and serve to block land \ndevelopment, forestry, mining, etc.  While the NDP has been supportive of the \nFirst Nations land claims process while in office, the promised Liberal \nreferendum would seem to suggest that the Liberals intend to backtrack and \nnot recognize the First Nations' rights.  In other words, there would be an \nincreased impetus for mining and forestry.  This development is surprising \nsince the Liberals have traditionally enjoyed strong Indian support, and the \nland claims process was originally started under a Liberal government.  If \nthe Liberals press forward with a referendum on the process, there is the \npotential for violent flare-ups between the First Nations and the \ngovernment.  (These flare-ups have occurred in the past, though not recently.)\nBPA\nBPA is urging the White House to increase its authority to borrow from the \nfederal Treasury by $2 billion to build over 20 new projects for 500-kilovolt \ntransmission lines and substations online between 2003 and 2006.  BPA \nofficials hope the new borrowing authority will be included in a \ncomprehensive energy strategy the Bush administration is expected to release \nnext week, although federal officials have yet to give the final word on the \nBPA request.  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, key members of Congress and \nthe staff of Vice President Dick Cheney, who has taken charge of developing \nthe administration's energy strategy, all have been briefed on BPA's \nproposal.  BPA has been building a case for a budget item that officials say \nwould be a significant boost to the region's power infrastructure in the near \nterm. If the administration doesn't include it in its energy strategy, BPA \nofficials say they will nevertheless press for the increased borrowing \nauthority in Congress.   BPA plans for the first time to use more \"fish \ncredits\" than cash to meet its annual debt obligation, reducing its cash \noutlay by some $400 million.  BPA had expected its borrowing authority to be \nsufficient until 2006, but given the energy situation, BPA could hit the \nceiling by 2003. \nBPA will be spilling water over its dams as a part of the salmon protection \nplan.  To make up for the shortfall, the agency will have to repurchase \napproximately $1.2 billion on the electricity spot market -- these costs will \nbe passed on to energy consumers as a part of the subscription rate hike in \nOctober.  Oregon Governor Kitzhaber is pushing for more spills.  Steve Wright \n& other BPA officials are considering the effects of keeping water in the \nreservoirs as a safety net, should there be a cold spell next winter, which \nhas precipitated a federal lawsuit from 12 environmental organizations \nagainst the National Marine Fisheries Service.\nEarthjustice Legal Defense Fund is leading this charge, a coalition which \nincludes Trout Unlimited and the Sierra Club.  The official line is they want \nto disallow the Federal Caucus and BPA from declaring a 'fish emergency' \nwhich would allow them to determine the amount of water spilled over the \ndams, among other things.  However, by exercising a 'fish emergency', BPA \nbecomes qualified for additional federal credits - which is probably the real \nsource of contention here.\nAluminum Smelters\nThe bill passed by the House Energy Committee  yesterday does extend the \nresale rights of the smelters to 1500 megawatts of  power beyond the October \n2001 termination date.  BPA is negotiating, even though they have no legal  \nobligation to serve the smelters.  New attack ads paid for by the  aluminum \ncompanies are running to build political pressure to continue to  receive and \nresell 1500 megawatts of power beyond October 2001, in addition to  receiving \nother payments for staying offline."}

So Pacific Gas \nand Electric Co., with the happy acquiescence of the state, dumped a huge, \nlong-term gas contract with El Paso. \n\t\tFor the state, the decision was a no-brainer: PG&E was buying more space on \ngas pipelines than it needed. \n\t\tFor El Paso, though, it was a disaster. The company started handing out pink \nslips like they were candy. \n\t\tBut in the long run, it wasn't El Paso that would end up on its knees. It \nwould be PG&E and the state of California. \n\t\tThat pipeline space that the utility and regulators saw as unnecessary would \nsoon become precious -- and El Paso, led by a law-sharp chairman with \nbare-knuckle smarts, would turn itself into the biggest natural gas firm in \nthe world. \n\t\tSo big, in fact, that in the eyes of vengeance-minded lawmakers and \nregulators, El Paso has become a poster monster for how Californians came to \nbe plagued by rolling blackouts and sky-high energy bills. \n\t\t\"They didn't mind seeing all of us at El Paso being dealt a terrible blow \nback then,\" said Randy Wu, an El Paso manager then. \"And now . . . well, \nlet's just say they should have planned better.\" -- -- -- \n\t\tIt's not like El Paso was some new kid on the block. \n\t\tThe company was founded in Texas in 1928 and stayed a local concern until \n1947, when it laid out 700 miles of pipeline to deliver gas to California. \n\t\tIt grew steadily from there until 1964, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided \nEl Paso was getting too big and ordered it to divest its pipeline holdings in \nthe Northwest. That set off a long tumble that William Wise, who had started \nat the company as a general counsel in 1970, set out to reverse when he took \nover as president in 1989. \n\t\tWise, a 56-year-old whose lean build reflects both his passion for running \nand his reputation for driving himself hard, is a rare bird in the world of \noil. \n\t\tThe University of Colorado law school graduate has mastered both the legal \nside of his \"litigious\" industry, as he once called it, and its hardball \neconomic strategies -- skills he honed by surfing the bust-boom cycles of his \nbusiness at its epicenter, Texas. \n\t\tThose skills came in handy when El Paso got the hammer blow from PG&E in 1996 \nand 1997. \n\t\tPG&E had been buying extra space on pipelines crossing into the state at the \nArizona ghost town of Topock -- enough to import a whopping 1.1 billion cubic \nfeet of natural gas a day. \n\t\tThe trouble for El Paso was that when PG&E dropped the contract for the \npipeline space, $170 million of the company's annual revenue was erased. \n\t\t\"It seemed like everyone thought the company was toast,\" said Wu, the former \nEl Paso manager. \"Of course, California didn't care at all.\" \n\t\tBut Patrick Power, the attorney hired by El Paso to plead the pipeline \ncompany's case before the state Public Utilities Commission back in 1996, \ncould see trouble looming for the state. \n\t\tIf PG&E and other utilities didn't keep the pipeline capacity to meet future \nneeds, he warned, they would probably regret it later. His words fell on deaf \nears. \n\t\t\"The mentality at the PUC, PG&E and Southern California Gas was, 'This will \nbe El Paso's problem,' \" Power said. -- -- -- \n\t\tWise reacted to the loss of the PG&E contract by taking no salary himself for \na year and freezing his executives' pay, Wu said. While laying off more than \none-third of the company's workers, he and his staff negotiated a hefty \nsettlement from PG&E and other companies in exchange for their having dropped \nthe pipeline space. \n\t\tThen Wise set off on a plan to absorb other pipeline companies so he could \nexpand his system of delivering natural gas throughout the United States. \n\t\t\"Bill Wise knew California had turned its back on the company, so he had to \nget creative,\" Wu said of Wise, who has declined interview requests from The \nChronicle. \n\t\t\"Attorneys generally don't have a lot of common sense in my mind, but Bill - \n- he's got extra,\" said former El Paso Mayor Larry Francis. \"He cuts his \nlosses in a hurry, and he recognizes when he has to move on. And so he \nmoved.\" \n\t\tWithin a few years, Wise stretched the now Houston-based company to full \n\"wellhead to wire\" operations, running everything from natural gas drilling \nto electric generation plants. Before El Paso embarked on this expansion, \nCalifornia constituted fully two-thirds of El Paso's natural gas sales -- \nmuch of that to PG&E. \n\t\tThe strategy was that if the state was going to ditch El Paso, El Paso would \nmake sure its reach became so extended in other directions that it would \nnever be dependent on one market again. \n\t\tWise's company scooped up interests in 40 electric power plants in 11 states \nby April 2000. Along the way, it spent billions acquiring enough pipeline \ncompanies to spread the El Paso reach along 58,000 miles of pipe nationwide, \nfrom Bakersfield to Boston. \n\t\t\"The company was a very traditional gas company until then,\" said Fred \nPickel, a Los Angeles energy consultant who has observed El Paso since the \n1970s. \"Wise, though, understands the street-level complexities of the \nbusiness, and what he had the company do was partly smart and partly logic. \n\t\t\"He was just able to see the possibilities that nobody here in California was \nable to see.\" \n\t\tBut some believe that what El Paso did to take advantage of those \npossibilities took unfair advantage of California. \n\t\tIn his cluttered downtown San Francisco office at the PUC, staff attorney \nHarvey Morris thought he \"smelled a rat\" as long as three years ago. \n\t\tMorris, a natty 47-year-old graduate of Boalt Hall School of Law, takes on \nthe look of a determined terrier when he outlines his suspicions about El \nPaso -- and he's been carrying that look a long time now. \n\t\tAfter losing PG&E, El Paso leased the utility's entire block of pipeline \ncapacity to another Texas gas and electricity giant, Dynegy. Gas experts were \nstunned that one firm would bid for all that space -- but they, and Morris, \nwere even more surprised by what followed. \n\t\tDynegy didn't behave the way PG&E and California officials had expected \nenergy companies to behave in the era of deregulation. \n\t\tLike PG&E, Dynegy didn't need all that pipeline space to serve its own \ncustomers. But unlike what PG&E did when confronted with all that extra \nspace, Dynegy didn't resell it at a huge discount. In fact, Dynegy didn't \nsell any of the space. Instead, it raised the price so high that seemingly \nnobody wanted to buy it. \n\t\tCompeting gas marketers were alarmed. They suspected that Dynegy was \ncollaborating with El Paso to constrict the supply of gas flowing into \nCalifornia so prices would rise. Great for anyone with space reserved on the \npipeline -- but disastrous for those left out in the cold. \n\t\tIn 1998, having convinced his bosses at the PUC that what El Paso was doing \non the Dynegy contract was anticompetitive, Morris filed the first of many \ncomplaints with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He's still pursuing \nthem. \n\t\tAs it turned out, spot prices didn't rise while Dynegy held the contract; gas \nshippers could still find space on other pipelines for less money. Dynegy let \nthe contract lapse in late 1999. \n\t\tNot long afterward, the pipeline contract wound up with El Paso's market \naffiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy. And that's when things started to get \nreally serious, Morris says. \n\t\tEl Paso's own marketing arm now controlled more pipeline space heading into \nSouthern California than any other trader by far -- just as the demand for \ngas was about to soar. \n\t\tIn his many filings, in which the PUC has been joined by Southern California \nEdison and others, Morris contends that El Paso Merchant Energy prevented \npipeline space from being used. \n\t\t\"They basically kept so much of the capacity to themselves, the prices went \nthrough the roof,\" he said. \"It was the same as closing off part of the \npipeline.\" \n\t\tEl Paso officials, for their part, say market rates started soaring in 2000 \nsimply because the demand for gas overwhelmed supply. They say they never \ncharged more than what industry rules allowed, and that attempts to prove \notherwise are preposterous. \n\t\tAnd thus far, except for a mild rebuke here and there on technicalities, the \nfree-market-minded Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has not concluded the \ncompany did anything wrong -- though a commission hearing is set for tomorrow \non the latest allegations filed by PG&E, Edison and the PUC. \n\t\tEdison estimates that El Paso's \"manipulation\" at Topock jacked up rates all \nover the industry so badly that state gas buyers had to pay $3.8 billion more \nthan they should have just in the past year. \n\t\tWhatever the reason, the bottom line is that gas prices in California have \nbeen anywhere from two to 10 times as expensive as on the other side of the \nborder in Arizona, and in almost every other state. \n\t\tOnce prices started to rise at Topock, gas marketers throughout California \nfollowed suit -- and the ripple spread quickly. \n\t\tGas prices for consumers started going up. The rise also propelled \nelectricity costs skyward, because three out of every five electricity plants \nin California run on natural gas. \n\t\tThe firms that own those plants then jacked up electricity prices to the \nutilities, like PG&E, which had shed many of their own plants as part of \nderegulation. \n\t\tThe problem for PG&E and other utilities is that they couldn't pass those \nhigher electricity costs on to their customers, because electricity rates \nwere still regulated. \n\t\tSo the red ink started to gush, in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And, \n\t\twith gas prices still higher here than anywhere else, it is still gushing. \n\t\tBut not for El Paso. -- -- -- \n\t\tEl Paso Energy rose from its financial emergency in 1996 to become not just a \nsurvivor, but a $50 billion behemoth involved in virtually every aspect of \nthe energy industry in California and much of the rest of the United States. \n\t\tThe company, renamed El Paso Corp. this February, is now practically printing \nmoney. The company's revenue shot from $1 billion in 1995 to $22 billion last \nyear; its profit last year alone was $652 million, its highest ever. Wise's \ncompensation package reportedly totaled $20 million. \n\t\tAnd it's not just with gas that El Paso is making its money. Among its \nholdings are 19 small power plants serving PG&E and Southern California \nEdison. \n\t\tUnder El Paso's contracts, the price of that electricity automatically rises \nwhen the price of gas rises. That's true even at the power plants that don't \nuse any natural gas. \n\t\tAll told, in just a bit more than one year alone, consultants for Edison say \nEl Paso earned an extra $85 million thanks to electricity produced by those \nplants. \n\t\tAnd all this is blossoming for El Paso while PG&E wallows in bankruptcy \ncourt, billions of dollars in debt with no relief in sight. \n\t\tThe one cloud on El Paso's horizon: A host of California legislators, \nindustry experts and state regulators suspect that El Paso's sunny profit \npicture owes a lot to what happened with that huge block of space on El \nPaso's natural gas pipeline that PG&E had been so happy to surrender. \n\t\tThe hearing before federal regulators is looming tomorrow, and just last \nmonth the state Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight dragged three top \nEl Paso executives -- but not Wise -- to Sacramento to testify on the matter. \n\t\tIt was the first time the company has ever felt such heat in this state. And \nthough the executives grimly waved off reporters' questions as they strode \nfrom the room, company spokeswoman Norma Dunn stayed behind to insist that \nthe accusations will blow over, \"because there's nothing to them. \n\t\t\"The thing to remember is that we have been in this state for more than 50 \nyears, and we want to continue being here,\" Dunn said. \"We take this matter \nvery seriously. . . . We want to be cooperative.\" \n\t\tAccusations that El Paso caused price spikes by maneuvering to hold pipeline \nspace hostage amount to \"nothing but conspiracy theories,\" she said. \n\t\tThe Assembly panel, however, concluded that both El Paso and Dynegy had \nmanipulated the market at an enormous cost to California consumers. \n\t\t\"The numbers tell the truth,\" the subcommittee said in a report obtained by \nThe Chronicle. \"The exorbitant prices cannot be defined away by regulators \nand bureaucrats, or explained away by corporate lawyers' wordplay.\" The \nreport was produced by three Assembly Democrats and two Republicans. \n\t\tWise, when he addresses the accusations, says he is mystified why state \nlawmakers are mad. He points to company plans to expand pipelines heading \nhere and to even build a power plant at San Francisco International Airport. \n\t\tWhen it comes to California, \"El Paso has always tried to be a part of the \nsolution, not the problem,\" he told a gas industry newsletter in December. \n\t\tState lawmakers' attempts to pry extensive hard numbers from El Paso have \nbeen met with resistance from the company, which calls them proprietary \ninformation. And judging by Morris' experience, chasing El Paso to the ground \nmay take the Legislature quite a while, if that's what it decides it wants to \ndo. \n\t\tMorris found that as he filed complaint after complaint against the company, \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would either rule against the PUC or \nput the filings off so long that they were moot when they came up. \n\t\tThe Assembly subcommittee's report was scathing in regard to the commission, \n\t\tsaying its approval of El Paso pipeline contracts \"raises serious questions \nabout whether it met its statutory duty under the federal Natural Gas Act to \nprotect consumers from unjust and unreasonable rates.\" \n\t\tThe commission did not send anyone to the Assembly hearings and has refused \nto comment on its rulings. \n\t\tBy the time the El Paso Merchant Energy contract expires May 31, opening the \ncrucial block of pipeline capacity to what critics say is true competition \nfor the first time in more than three years, it will be far too late, Morris \nsaid. \n\t\t\"The damage was done long ago,\" Morris said. The state and its utilities are \non the hook for billions in debt, money for last winter's bills has already \nleft consumers' pockets -- and regulators fear prices are unlikely to come \ndown soon. \n\t\t\"The market got set, and now we're in trouble,\" Morris said. -- -- -- \n\t\tPG&E, for its part, sees the whole mess through the eyes of a victim. \n\t\tThe utility had paid $560 million to hold its excess El Paso capacity from \n1993 to 1997, and the PUC had forbidden the company to recover $167 million \nof that through customer rates. And in 1996, the PUC and ratepayers were \nclamoring for lower power bills, and there was a huge amount of pipeline \nspace in the state that wasn't being used. \n\t\tSo when you're trying to cut costs, what better to cut than something you \ndon't need? said Dan Thomas, PG&E's director of gas transmission. \n\t\t\"I still think it was the right decision to relinquish the capacity,\" he \nsaid. \n\t\tStill, there's no denying the numbers. At latest count, PG&E owed El Paso \nmore than $150 million for gas and electricity. \n\t\tAs Morris sees it, El Paso is \"this big, 800-pound gorilla at the border and \ncan limit supplies as they wish. It's outrageous, and there wasn't a thing \nanybody could do to stop them.\" \n\t\tEl Paso officials, of course, put it differently. \n\t\t\"All we did was good business, smart business, and people keep dishing dirt \nabout us, but we just don't see ourselves in it,\" company spokesman Mel Scott \nsaid. \n\t\t\"It's pretty obvious to the analysts and to us that California set up this \nfaulty deregulation system, and if (PG&E and Southern California utilities) \nhad been in their right minds and signed up for long-term natural gas \ncontracts back in 1996 and 1997, they wouldn't be in this trouble.\" \n\t\tNobody official at El Paso is publicly gloating, but pleasure over the turn \nof events is never far from the surface. Those who can speak more freely \ndon't mind putting the boot in a bit. \n\t\t\"Everything bad that's happening right now (in the pipeline fight) could have \nbeen prevented if PG&E just hadn't gotten rid of that contract back then, \" \nWu said. \"But I have yet to hear anyone in this state say that. \n\t\t\"In fact, I have yet to hear anyone even at PG&E say that, and that's sad.\" \n\t\tWhat it all comes down to is this: El Paso figured out how to play \nCalifornia's energy game better than California. \n\t\t\"Those laws your boys passed there in California -- well, they just left you \nwide open to anyone who wanted to make an enormous profit,\" said Tom \"Smitty\" \nSmith, director of the Austin headquarters of Public Citizen, a consumer \nrights group. \n\t\t\"You can't fault the horse for eating hay when you lead it to the barn and \nput the bale right in front of its face, now can you?\" \nCalifornia's 'energy island' \n\t\tThere are just four points at the border where natural gas comes into \nenergy-starved California. The main one, owned by El Paso, is at the Colorado \nRiver. The pipelines originate in the Southwest. They wind 1,000 miles \nthrough several states to pop up right where Route 66 used to cut over the \nColorado River on its famous arched steel bridge. Today two of El Paso's \npipelines are all that use the old bridge. \n\t\t\n\nKenneth Shulklapper\nMedia Risk Management\nEnron Media Services\n(713) 853-7009 (phone)\n(713) 646-8436 (fax)"}

{"from": "Ken Shulklapper", "to": "Phillip K Allen", "content": "\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tHow Texas firm outfoxed state, PG&E\nKevin Fagan, Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writers \n\t\t?\n\t\tSunday, May 13, 2001 \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEl Paso Energy was facing ruin. \n\t\tIt was the mid-'90s, and California's energy overseers were sure deregulation \nwas going to drive the cost of natural gas through the floor. So Pacific Gas \nand Electric Co., with the happy acquiescence of the state, dumped a huge, \nlong-term gas contract with El Paso. \n\t\tFor the state, the decision was a no-brainer: PG&E was buying more space on \ngas pipelines than it needed. \n\t\tFor El Paso, though, it was a disaster. The company started handing out pink \nslips like they were candy. \n\t\tBut in the long run, it wasn't El Paso that would end up on its knees. It \nwould be PG&E and the state of California. \n\t\tThat pipeline space that the utility and regulators saw as unnecessary would \nsoon become precious -- and El Paso, led by a law-sharp chairman with \nbare-knuckle smarts, would turn itself into the biggest natural gas firm in \nthe world. \n\t\tSo big, in fact, that in the eyes of vengeance-minded lawmakers and \nregulators, El Paso has become a poster monster for how Californians came to \nbe plagued by rolling blackouts and sky-high energy bills. \n\t\t\"They didn't mind seeing all of us at El Paso being dealt a terrible blow \nback then,\" said Randy Wu, an El Paso manager then. \"And now . . . well, \nlet's just say they should have planned better.\" -- -- -- \n\t\tIt's not like El Paso was some new kid on the block. \n\t\tThe company was founded in Texas in 1928 and stayed a local concern until \n1947, when it laid out 700 miles of pipeline to deliver gas to California. \n\t\tIt grew steadily from there until 1964, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided \nEl Paso was getting too big and ordered it to divest its pipeline holdings in \nthe Northwest. That set off a long tumble that William Wise, who had started \nat the company as a general counsel in 1970, set out to reverse when he took \nover as president in 1989. \n\t\tWise, a 56-year-old whose lean build reflects both his passion for running \nand his reputation for driving himself hard, is a rare bird in the world of \noil. \n\t\tThe University of Colorado law school graduate has mastered both the legal \nside of his \"litigious\" industry, as he once called it, and its hardball \neconomic strategies -- skills he honed by surfing the bust-boom cycles of his \nbusiness at its epicenter, Texas. \n\t\tThose skills came in handy when El Paso got the hammer blow from PG&E in 1996 \nand 1997. \n\t\tPG&E had been buying extra space on pipelines crossing into the state at the \nArizona ghost town of Topock -- enough to import a whopping 1.1 billion cubic \nfeet of natural gas a day. \n\t\tThe trouble for El Paso was that when PG&E dropped the contract for the \npipeline space, $170 million of the company's annual revenue was erased. \n\t\t\"It seemed like everyone thought the company was toast,\" said Wu, the former \nEl Paso manager. \"Of course, California didn't care at all.\" \n\t\tBut Patrick Power, the attorney hired by El Paso to plead the pipeline \ncompany's case before the state Public Utilities Commission back in 1996, \ncould see trouble looming for the state. \n\t\tIf PG&E and other utilities didn't keep the pipeline capacity to meet future \nneeds, he warned, they would probably regret it later. His words fell on deaf \nears. \n\t\t\"The mentality at the PUC, PG&E and Southern California Gas was, 'This will \nbe El Paso's problem,' \" Power said. -- -- -- \n\t\tWise reacted to the loss of the PG&E contract by taking no salary himself for \na year and freezing his executives' pay, Wu said. While laying off more than \none-third of the company's workers, he and his staff negotiated a hefty \nsettlement from PG&E and other companies in exchange for their having dropped \nthe pipeline space. \n\t\tThen Wise set off on a plan to absorb other pipeline companies so he could \nexpand his system of delivering natural gas throughout the United States. \n\t\t\"Bill Wise knew California had turned its back on the company, so he had to \nget creative,\" Wu said of Wise, who has declined interview requests from The \nChronicle. \n\t\t\"Attorneys generally don't have a lot of common sense in my mind, but Bill - \n- he's got extra,\" said former El Paso Mayor Larry Francis. \"He cuts his \nlosses in a hurry, and he recognizes when he has to move on. And so he \nmoved.\" \n\t\tWithin a few years, Wise stretched the now Houston-based company to full \n\"wellhead to wire\" operations, running everything from natural gas drilling \nto electric generation plants. Before El Paso embarked on this expansion, \nCalifornia constituted fully two-thirds of El Paso's natural gas sales -- \nmuch of that to PG&E. \n\t\tThe strategy was that if the state was going to ditch El Paso, El Paso would \nmake sure its reach became so extended in other directions that it would \nnever be dependent on one market again. \n\t\tWise's company scooped up interests in 40 electric power plants in 11 states \nby April 2000. Along the way, it spent billions acquiring enough pipeline \ncompanies to spread the El Paso reach along 58,000 miles of pipe nationwide, \nfrom Bakersfield to Boston. \n\t\t\"The company was a very traditional gas company until then,\" said Fred \nPickel, a Los Angeles energy consultant who has observed El Paso since the \n1970s. \"Wise, though, understands the street-level complexities of the \nbusiness, and what he had the company do was partly smart and partly logic. \n\t\t\"He was just able to see the possibilities that nobody here in California was \nable to see.\" \n\t\tBut some believe that what El Paso did to take advantage of those \npossibilities took unfair advantage of California. \n\t\tIn his cluttered downtown San Francisco office at the PUC, staff attorney \nHarvey Morris thought he \"smelled a rat\" as long as three years ago. \n\t\tMorris, a natty 47-year-old graduate of Boalt Hall School of Law, takes on \nthe look of a determined terrier when he outlines his suspicions about El \nPaso -- and he's been carrying that look a long time now. \n\t\tAfter losing PG&E, El Paso leased the utility's entire block of pipeline \ncapacity to another Texas gas and electricity giant, Dynegy. Gas experts were \nstunned that one firm would bid for all that space -- but they, and Morris, \nwere even more surprised by what followed. \n\t\tDynegy didn't behave the way PG&E and California officials had expected \nenergy companies to behave in the era of deregulation. \n\t\tLike PG&E, Dynegy didn't need all that pipeline space to serve its own \ncustomers. But unlike what PG&E did when confronted with all that extra \nspace, Dynegy didn't resell it at a huge discount. In fact, Dynegy didn't \nsell any of the space. Instead, it raised the price so high that seemingly \nnobody wanted to buy it. \n\t\tCompeting gas marketers were alarmed. They suspected that Dynegy was \ncollaborating with El Paso to constrict the supply of gas flowing into \nCalifornia so prices would rise. Great for anyone with space reserved on the \npipeline -- but disastrous for those left out in the cold. \n\t\tIn 1998, having convinced his bosses at the PUC that what El Paso was doing \non the Dynegy contract was anticompetitive, Morris filed the first of many \ncomplaints with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He's still pursuing \nthem. \n\t\tAs it turned out, spot prices didn't rise while Dynegy held the contract; gas \nshippers could still find space on other pipelines for less money. Dynegy let \nthe contract lapse in late 1999. \n\t\tNot long afterward, the pipeline contract wound up with El Paso's market \naffiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy. And that's when things started to get \nreally serious, Morris says. \n\t\tEl Paso's own marketing arm now controlled more pipeline space heading into \nSouthern California than any other trader by far -- just as the demand for \ngas was about to soar. \n\t\tIn his many filings, in which the PUC has been joined by Southern California \nEdison and others, Morris contends that El Paso Merchant Energy prevented \npipeline space from being used. \n\t\t\"They basically kept so much of the capacity to themselves, the prices went \nthrough the roof,\" he said. \"It was the same as closing off part of the \npipeline.\" \n\t\tEl Paso officials, for their part, say market rates started soaring in 2000 \nsimply because the demand for gas overwhelmed supply. They say they never \ncharged more than what industry rules allowed, and that attempts to prove \notherwise are preposterous. \n\t\tAnd thus far, except for a mild rebuke here and there on technicalities, the \nfree-market-minded Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has not concluded the \ncompany did anything wrong -- though a commission hearing is set for tomorrow \non the latest allegations filed by PG&E, Edison and the PUC. \n\t\tEdison estimates that El Paso's \"manipulation\" at Topock jacked up rates all \nover the industry so badly that state gas buyers had to pay $3.8 billion more \nthan they should have just in the past year. \n\t\tWhatever the reason, the bottom line is that gas prices in California have \nbeen anywhere from two to 10 times as expensive as on the other side of the \nborder in Arizona, and in almost every other state. \n\t\tOnce prices started to rise at Topock, gas marketers throughout California \nfollowed suit -- and the ripple spread quickly. \n\t\tGas prices for consumers started going up. The rise also propelled \nelectricity costs skyward, because three out of every five electricity plants \nin California run on natural gas. \n\t\tThe firms that own those plants then jacked up electricity prices to the \nutilities, like PG&E, which had shed many of their own plants as part of \nderegulation. \n\t\tThe problem for PG&E and other utilities is that they couldn't pass those \nhigher electricity costs on to their customers, because electricity rates \nwere still regulated. \n\t\tSo the red ink started to gush, in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And, \n\t\twith gas prices still higher here than anywhere else, it is still gushing. \n\t\tBut not for El Paso. -- -- -- \n\t\tEl Paso Energy rose from its financial emergency in 1996 to become not just a \nsurvivor, but a $50 billion behemoth involved in virtually every aspect of \nthe energy industry in California and much of the rest of the United States. \n\t\tThe company, renamed El Paso Corp. this February, is now practically printing \nmoney. The company's revenue shot from $1 billion in 1995 to $22 billion last \nyear; its profit last year alone was $652 million, its highest ever. Wise's \ncompensation package reportedly totaled $20 million. \n\t\tAnd it's not just with gas that El Paso is making its money. Among its \nholdings are 19 small power plants serving PG&E and Southern California \nEdison. \n\t\tUnder El Paso's contracts, the price of that electricity automatically rises \nwhen the price of gas rises. That's true even at the power plants that don't \nuse any natural gas. \n\t\tAll told, in just a bit more than one year alone, consultants for Edison say \nEl Paso earned an extra $85 million thanks to electricity produced by those \nplants. \n\t\tAnd all this is blossoming for El Paso while PG&E wallows in bankruptcy \ncourt, billions of dollars in debt with no relief in sight. \n\t\tThe one cloud on El Paso's horizon: A host of California legislators, \nindustry experts and state regulators suspect that El Paso's sunny profit \npicture owes a lot to what happened with that huge block of space on El \nPaso's natural gas pipeline that PG&E had been so happy to surrender. \n\t\tThe hearing before federal regulators is looming tomorrow, and just last \nmonth the state Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight dragged three top \nEl Paso executives -- but not Wise -- to Sacramento to testify on the matter. \n\t\tIt was the first time the company has ever felt such heat in this state. And \nthough the executives grimly waved off reporters' questions as they strode \nfrom the room, company spokeswoman Norma Dunn stayed behind to insist that \nthe accusations will blow over, \"because there's nothing to them. \n\t\t\"The thing to remember is that we have been in this state for more than 50 \nyears, and we want to continue being here,\" Dunn said. \"We take this matter \nvery seriously. . . . We want to be cooperative.\" \n\t\tAccusations that El Paso caused price spikes by maneuvering to hold pipeline \nspace hostage amount to \"nothing but conspiracy theories,\" she said. \n\t\tThe Assembly panel, however, concluded that both El Paso and Dynegy had \nmanipulated the market at an enormous cost to California consumers. \n\t\t\"The numbers tell the truth,\" the subcommittee said in a report obtained by \nThe Chronicle. \"The exorbitant prices cannot be defined away by regulators \nand bureaucrats, or explained away by corporate lawyers' wordplay.\" The \nreport was produced by three Assembly Democrats and two Republicans. \n\t\tWise, when he addresses the accusations, says he is mystified why state \nlawmakers are mad. He points to company plans to expand pipelines heading \nhere and to even build a power plant at San Francisco International Airport. \n\t\tWhen it comes to California, \"El Paso has always tried to be a part of the \nsolution, not the problem,\" he told a gas industry newsletter in December. \n\t\tState lawmakers' attempts to pry extensive hard numbers from El Paso have \nbeen met with resistance from the company, which calls them proprietary \ninformation. And judging by Morris' experience, chasing El Paso to the ground \nmay take the Legislature quite a while, if that's what it decides it wants to \ndo. \n\t\tMorris found that as he filed complaint after complaint against the company, \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would either rule against the PUC or \nput the filings off so long that they were moot when they came up. \n\t\tThe Assembly subcommittee's report was scathing in regard to the commission, \n\t\tsaying its approval of El Paso pipeline contracts \"raises serious questions \nabout whether it met its statutory duty under the federal Natural Gas Act to \nprotect consumers from unjust and unreasonable rates.\" \n\t\tThe commission did not send anyone to the Assembly hearings and has refused \nto comment on its rulings. \n\t\tBy the time the El Paso Merchant Energy contract expires May 31, opening the \ncrucial block of pipeline capacity to what critics say is true competition \nfor the first time in more than three years, it will be far too late, Morris \nsaid. \n\t\t\"The damage was done long ago,\" Morris said. The state and its utilities are \non the hook for billions in debt, money for last winter's bills has already \nleft consumers' pockets -- and regulators fear prices are unlikely to come \ndown soon. \n\t\t\"The market got set, and now we're in trouble,\" Morris said. -- -- -- \n\t\tPG&E, for its part, sees the whole mess through the eyes of a victim. \n\t\tThe utility had paid $560 million to hold its excess El Paso capacity from \n1993 to 1997, and the PUC had forbidden the company to recover $167 million \nof that through customer rates. And in 1996, the PUC and ratepayers were \nclamoring for lower power bills, and there was a huge amount of pipeline \nspace in the state that wasn't being used. \n\t\tSo when you're trying to cut costs, what better to cut than something you \ndon't need? said Dan Thomas, PG&E's director of gas transmission. \n\t\t\"I still think it was the right decision to relinquish the capacity,\" he \nsaid. \n\t\tStill, there's no denying the numbers. At latest count, PG&E owed El Paso \nmore than $150 million for gas and electricity. \n\t\tAs Morris sees it, El Paso is \"this big, 800-pound gorilla at the border and \ncan limit supplies as they wish. It's outrageous, and there wasn't a thing \nanybody could do to stop them.\" \n\t\tEl Paso officials, of course, put it differently. \n\t\t\"All we did was good business, smart business, and people keep dishing dirt \nabout us, but we just don't see ourselves in it,\" company spokesman Mel Scott \nsaid. \n\t\t\"It's pretty obvious to the analysts and to us that California set up this \nfaulty deregulation system, and if (PG&E and Southern California utilities) \nhad been in their right minds and signed up for long-term natural gas \ncontracts back in 1996 and 1997, they wouldn't be in this trouble.\" \n\t\tNobody official at El Paso is publicly gloating, but pleasure over the turn \nof events is never far from the surface. Those who can speak more freely \ndon't mind putting the boot in a bit. \n\t\t\"Everything bad that's happening right now (in the pipeline fight) could have \nbeen prevented if PG&E just hadn't gotten rid of that contract back then, \" \nWu said. \"But I have yet to hear anyone in this state say that. \n\t\t\"In fact, I have yet to hear anyone even at PG&E say that, and that's sad.\" \n\t\tWhat it all comes down to is this: El Paso figured out how to play \nCalifornia's energy game better than California. \n\t\t\"Those laws your boys passed there in California -- well, they just left you \nwide open to anyone who wanted to make an enormous profit,\" said Tom \"Smitty\" \nSmith, director of the Austin headquarters of Public Citizen, a consumer \nrights group. \n\t\t\"You can't fault the horse for eating hay when you lead it to the barn and \nput the bale right in front of its face, now can you?\" \nCalifornia's 'energy island' \n\t\tThere are just four points at the border where natural gas comes into \nenergy-starved California. The main one, owned by El Paso, is at the Colorado \nRiver. The pipelines originate in the Southwest. They wind 1,000 miles \nthrough several states to pop up right where Route 66 used to cut over the \nColorado River on its famous arched steel bridge. Today two of El Paso's \npipelines are all that use the old bridge. \n\t\t\n\nKenneth Shulklapper\nMedia Risk Management\nEnron Media Services\n(713) 853-7009 (phone)\n(713) 646-8436 (fax)"}

BPA seeks Federal Loan for Improvements, Future Fish Credits Limited  \n? Washington House Extends Aluminum Smelters' Power Re-Sale Rights by 1,500 \nMWs \nBC Elections\nAccording to our information, the BC government is preparing for the Liberal \ntake this week.  The election is slated for 16 May 2001 and it appears likely \nthat we are looking at a near Liberal sweep -- they are currently leading 41% \nto 25% at the polls.  There is about a three-week lead time between the \ngeneral election on May 16th, the Final Count on May 29th, and the Return Day \non June 7th -- so there will be a period of jockeying around some issues.  \nThe New Democratic Party (NDP) leader, Ujjal Dosanjh, has effectively \nconceded the election in a public announcement.  Dosanjh is making public \npleas to voters not to desert the NDP in favor of the Greens so that the NDP \ncan retain official party status (4 seats).  Dosanjh has stated that he \"will \nbe happy if the NDP gets 10 to 15 seats.\"\nThe following are likely to be the key energy policy officials once the \nLiberal Party takes power in BC:\n? Richard Neufeld, Minister of Energy, Mines and Northern Development \n(replacing NDP Minister Glenn Robertson)\n? Dan Jarvis, Deputy critic on Energy, Mines and Northern Development Murray \nCoell, Minister of Environment, Lands and Parks (replacing Ian Waddell) \n? John Van Dongen, Fisheries Neufeld, Jarvis, Coell and Van Dongen are \ncurrently Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs).\nWhile Gordon Campbell, the probable incoming premier, will have been \neffectively muzzled in the interim when it comes to talk about energy \nderegulation, the opposition will likely have plenty to say about it.  The \npeople we'll need to be looking at this regard are:  Glenn Robertson - \nMinister of Energy and Mines, and Ian Waddell - Minister of Environment, Land \n& Parks.  \nIt appears certain that the Liberals will move to privatize at least some of \nthe power crown corporations almost immediately.  They have promised a \nbalanced budget and a chunk of  money to do it their way; they have made \ncampaign promises about privatization to stir the economy; and they have \ntight back channels with the crown corporations' management who want \"a \nstraight privatization plan instead of coop approach to deregulation.\"  \nSources report that, if elected, the Liberals promise a referendum on land \nclaims treaties with the local native Indians (or \"First Nations\").  These \ntreaties result from overlapping claims to land and serve to block land \ndevelopment, forestry, mining, etc.  While the NDP has been supportive of the \nFirst Nations land claims process while in office, the promised Liberal \nreferendum would seem to suggest that the Liberals intend to backtrack and \nnot recognize the First Nations' rights.  In other words, there would be an \nincreased impetus for mining and forestry.  This development is surprising \nsince the Liberals have traditionally enjoyed strong Indian support, and the \nland claims process was originally started under a Liberal government.  If \nthe Liberals press forward with a referendum on the process, there is the \npotential for violent flare-ups between the First Nations and the \ngovernment.  (These flare-ups have occurred in the past, though not recently.)\nBPA\nBPA is urging the White House to increase its authority to borrow from the \nfederal Treasury by $2 billion to build over 20 new projects for 500-kilovolt \ntransmission lines and substations online between 2003 and 2006.  BPA \nofficials hope the new borrowing authority will be included in a \ncomprehensive energy strategy the Bush administration is expected to release \nnext week, although federal officials have yet to give the final word on the \nBPA request.  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, key members of Congress and \nthe staff of Vice President Dick Cheney, who has taken charge of developing \nthe administration's energy strategy, all have been briefed on BPA's \nproposal.  BPA has been building a case for a budget item that officials say \nwould be a significant boost to the region's power infrastructure in the near \nterm. If the administration doesn't include it in its energy strategy, BPA \nofficials say they will nevertheless press for the increased borrowing \nauthority in Congress.   BPA plans for the first time to use more \"fish \ncredits\" than cash to meet its annual debt obligation, reducing its cash \noutlay by some $400 million.  BPA had expected its borrowing authority to be \nsufficient until 2006, but given the energy situation, BPA could hit the \nceiling by 2003. \nBPA will be spilling water over its dams as a part of the salmon protection \nplan.  To make up for the shortfall, the agency will have to repurchase \napproximately $1.2 billion on the electricity spot market -- these costs will \nbe passed on to energy consumers as a part of the subscription rate hike in \nOctober.  Oregon Governor Kitzhaber is pushing for more spills.  Steve Wright \n& other BPA officials are considering the effects of keeping water in the \nreservoirs as a safety net, should there be a cold spell next winter, which \nhas precipitated a federal lawsuit from 12 environmental organizations \nagainst the National Marine Fisheries Service.\nEarthjustice Legal Defense Fund is leading this charge, a coalition which \nincludes Trout Unlimited and the Sierra Club.  The official line is they want \nto disallow the Federal Caucus and BPA from declaring a 'fish emergency' \nwhich would allow them to determine the amount of water spilled over the \ndams, among other things.  However, by exercising a 'fish emergency', BPA \nbecomes qualified for additional federal credits - which is probably the real \nsource of contention here.\nAluminum Smelters\nThe bill passed by the House Energy Committee  yesterday does extend the \nresale rights of the smelters to 1500 megawatts of  power beyond the October \n2001 termination date.  BPA is negotiating, even though they have no legal  \nobligation to serve the smelters.  New attack ads paid for by the  aluminum \ncompanies are running to build political pressure to continue to  receive and \nresell 1500 megawatts of power beyond October 2001, in addition to  receiving \nother payments for staying offline."}

So Pacific Gas \nand Electric Co., with the happy acquiescence of the state, dumped a huge, \nlong-term gas contract with El Paso. \n\t\tFor the state, the decision was a no-brainer: PG&E was buying more space on \ngas pipelines than it needed. \n\t\tFor El Paso, though, it was a disaster. The company started handing out pink \nslips like they were candy. \n\t\tBut in the long run, it wasn't El Paso that would end up on its knees. It \nwould be PG&E and the state of California. \n\t\tThat pipeline space that the utility and regulators saw as unnecessary would \nsoon become precious -- and El Paso, led by a law-sharp chairman with \nbare-knuckle smarts, would turn itself into the biggest natural gas firm in \nthe world. \n\t\tSo big, in fact, that in the eyes of vengeance-minded lawmakers and \nregulators, El Paso has become a poster monster for how Californians came to \nbe plagued by rolling blackouts and sky-high energy bills. \n\t\t\"They didn't mind seeing all of us at El Paso being dealt a terrible blow \nback then,\" said Randy Wu, an El Paso manager then. \"And now . . . well, \nlet's just say they should have planned better.\" -- -- -- \n\t\tIt's not like El Paso was some new kid on the block. \n\t\tThe company was founded in Texas in 1928 and stayed a local concern until \n1947, when it laid out 700 miles of pipeline to deliver gas to California. \n\t\tIt grew steadily from there until 1964, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided \nEl Paso was getting too big and ordered it to divest its pipeline holdings in \nthe Northwest. That set off a long tumble that William Wise, who had started \nat the company as a general counsel in 1970, set out to reverse when he took \nover as president in 1989. \n\t\tWise, a 56-year-old whose lean build reflects both his passion for running \nand his reputation for driving himself hard, is a rare bird in the world of \noil. \n\t\tThe University of Colorado law school graduate has mastered both the legal \nside of his \"litigious\" industry, as he once called it, and its hardball \neconomic strategies -- skills he honed by surfing the bust-boom cycles of his \nbusiness at its epicenter, Texas. \n\t\tThose skills came in handy when El Paso got the hammer blow from PG&E in 1996 \nand 1997. \n\t\tPG&E had been buying extra space on pipelines crossing into the state at the \nArizona ghost town of Topock -- enough to import a whopping 1.1 billion cubic \nfeet of natural gas a day. \n\t\tThe trouble for El Paso was that when PG&E dropped the contract for the \npipeline space, $170 million of the company's annual revenue was erased. \n\t\t\"It seemed like everyone thought the company was toast,\" said Wu, the former \nEl Paso manager. \"Of course, California didn't care at all.\" \n\t\tBut Patrick Power, the attorney hired by El Paso to plead the pipeline \ncompany's case before the state Public Utilities Commission back in 1996, \ncould see trouble looming for the state. \n\t\tIf PG&E and other utilities didn't keep the pipeline capacity to meet future \nneeds, he warned, they would probably regret it later. His words fell on deaf \nears. \n\t\t\"The mentality at the PUC, PG&E and Southern California Gas was, 'This will \nbe El Paso's problem,' \" Power said. -- -- -- \n\t\tWise reacted to the loss of the PG&E contract by taking no salary himself for \na year and freezing his executives' pay, Wu said. While laying off more than \none-third of the company's workers, he and his staff negotiated a hefty \nsettlement from PG&E and other companies in exchange for their having dropped \nthe pipeline space. \n\t\tThen Wise set off on a plan to absorb other pipeline companies so he could \nexpand his system of delivering natural gas throughout the United States. \n\t\t\"Bill Wise knew California had turned its back on the company, so he had to \nget creative,\" Wu said of Wise, who has declined interview requests from The \nChronicle. \n\t\t\"Attorneys generally don't have a lot of common sense in my mind, but Bill - \n- he's got extra,\" said former El Paso Mayor Larry Francis. \"He cuts his \nlosses in a hurry, and he recognizes when he has to move on. And so he \nmoved.\" \n\t\tWithin a few years, Wise stretched the now Houston-based company to full \n\"wellhead to wire\" operations, running everything from natural gas drilling \nto electric generation plants. Before El Paso embarked on this expansion, \nCalifornia constituted fully two-thirds of El Paso's natural gas sales -- \nmuch of that to PG&E. \n\t\tThe strategy was that if the state was going to ditch El Paso, El Paso would \nmake sure its reach became so extended in other directions that it would \nnever be dependent on one market again. \n\t\tWise's company scooped up interests in 40 electric power plants in 11 states \nby April 2000. Along the way, it spent billions acquiring enough pipeline \ncompanies to spread the El Paso reach along 58,000 miles of pipe nationwide, \nfrom Bakersfield to Boston. \n\t\t\"The company was a very traditional gas company until then,\" said Fred \nPickel, a Los Angeles energy consultant who has observed El Paso since the \n1970s. \"Wise, though, understands the street-level complexities of the \nbusiness, and what he had the company do was partly smart and partly logic. \n\t\t\"He was just able to see the possibilities that nobody here in California was \nable to see.\" \n\t\tBut some believe that what El Paso did to take advantage of those \npossibilities took unfair advantage of California. \n\t\tIn his cluttered downtown San Francisco office at the PUC, staff attorney \nHarvey Morris thought he \"smelled a rat\" as long as three years ago. \n\t\tMorris, a natty 47-year-old graduate of Boalt Hall School of Law, takes on \nthe look of a determined terrier when he outlines his suspicions about El \nPaso -- and he's been carrying that look a long time now. \n\t\tAfter losing PG&E, El Paso leased the utility's entire block of pipeline \ncapacity to another Texas gas and electricity giant, Dynegy. Gas experts were \nstunned that one firm would bid for all that space -- but they, and Morris, \nwere even more surprised by what followed. \n\t\tDynegy didn't behave the way PG&E and California officials had expected \nenergy companies to behave in the era of deregulation. \n\t\tLike PG&E, Dynegy didn't need all that pipeline space to serve its own \ncustomers. But unlike what PG&E did when confronted with all that extra \nspace, Dynegy didn't resell it at a huge discount. In fact, Dynegy didn't \nsell any of the space. Instead, it raised the price so high that seemingly \nnobody wanted to buy it. \n\t\tCompeting gas marketers were alarmed. They suspected that Dynegy was \ncollaborating with El Paso to constrict the supply of gas flowing into \nCalifornia so prices would rise. Great for anyone with space reserved on the \npipeline -- but disastrous for those left out in the cold. \n\t\tIn 1998, having convinced his bosses at the PUC that what El Paso was doing \non the Dynegy contract was anticompetitive, Morris filed the first of many \ncomplaints with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He's still pursuing \nthem. \n\t\tAs it turned out, spot prices didn't rise while Dynegy held the contract; gas \nshippers could still find space on other pipelines for less money. Dynegy let \nthe contract lapse in late 1999. \n\t\tNot long afterward, the pipeline contract wound up with El Paso's market \naffiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy. And that's when things started to get \nreally serious, Morris says. \n\t\tEl Paso's own marketing arm now controlled more pipeline space heading into \nSouthern California than any other trader by far -- just as the demand for \ngas was about to soar. \n\t\tIn his many filings, in which the PUC has been joined by Southern California \nEdison and others, Morris contends that El Paso Merchant Energy prevented \npipeline space from being used. \n\t\t\"They basically kept so much of the capacity to themselves, the prices went \nthrough the roof,\" he said. \"It was the same as closing off part of the \npipeline.\" \n\t\tEl Paso officials, for their part, say market rates started soaring in 2000 \nsimply because the demand for gas overwhelmed supply. They say they never \ncharged more than what industry rules allowed, and that attempts to prove \notherwise are preposterous. \n\t\tAnd thus far, except for a mild rebuke here and there on technicalities, the \nfree-market-minded Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has not concluded the \ncompany did anything wrong -- though a commission hearing is set for tomorrow \non the latest allegations filed by PG&E, Edison and the PUC. \n\t\tEdison estimates that El Paso's \"manipulation\" at Topock jacked up rates all \nover the industry so badly that state gas buyers had to pay $3.8 billion more \nthan they should have just in the past year. \n\t\tWhatever the reason, the bottom line is that gas prices in California have \nbeen anywhere from two to 10 times as expensive as on the other side of the \nborder in Arizona, and in almost every other state. \n\t\tOnce prices started to rise at Topock, gas marketers throughout California \nfollowed suit -- and the ripple spread quickly. \n\t\tGas prices for consumers started going up. The rise also propelled \nelectricity costs skyward, because three out of every five electricity plants \nin California run on natural gas. \n\t\tThe firms that own those plants then jacked up electricity prices to the \nutilities, like PG&E, which had shed many of their own plants as part of \nderegulation. \n\t\tThe problem for PG&E and other utilities is that they couldn't pass those \nhigher electricity costs on to their customers, because electricity rates \nwere still regulated. \n\t\tSo the red ink started to gush, in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And, \n\t\twith gas prices still higher here than anywhere else, it is still gushing. \n\t\tBut not for El Paso. -- -- -- \n\t\tEl Paso Energy rose from its financial emergency in 1996 to become not just a \nsurvivor, but a $50 billion behemoth involved in virtually every aspect of \nthe energy industry in California and much of the rest of the United States. \n\t\tThe company, renamed El Paso Corp. this February, is now practically printing \nmoney. The company's revenue shot from $1 billion in 1995 to $22 billion last \nyear; its profit last year alone was $652 million, its highest ever. Wise's \ncompensation package reportedly totaled $20 million. \n\t\tAnd it's not just with gas that El Paso is making its money. Among its \nholdings are 19 small power plants serving PG&E and Southern California \nEdison. \n\t\tUnder El Paso's contracts, the price of that electricity automatically rises \nwhen the price of gas rises. That's true even at the power plants that don't \nuse any natural gas. \n\t\tAll told, in just a bit more than one year alone, consultants for Edison say \nEl Paso earned an extra $85 million thanks to electricity produced by those \nplants. \n\t\tAnd all this is blossoming for El Paso while PG&E wallows in bankruptcy \ncourt, billions of dollars in debt with no relief in sight. \n\t\tThe one cloud on El Paso's horizon: A host of California legislators, \nindustry experts and state regulators suspect that El Paso's sunny profit \npicture owes a lot to what happened with that huge block of space on El \nPaso's natural gas pipeline that PG&E had been so happy to surrender. \n\t\tThe hearing before federal regulators is looming tomorrow, and just last \nmonth the state Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight dragged three top \nEl Paso executives -- but not Wise -- to Sacramento to testify on the matter. \n\t\tIt was the first time the company has ever felt such heat in this state. And \nthough the executives grimly waved off reporters' questions as they strode \nfrom the room, company spokeswoman Norma Dunn stayed behind to insist that \nthe accusations will blow over, \"because there's nothing to them. \n\t\t\"The thing to remember is that we have been in this state for more than 50 \nyears, and we want to continue being here,\" Dunn said. \"We take this matter \nvery seriously. . . . We want to be cooperative.\" \n\t\tAccusations that El Paso caused price spikes by maneuvering to hold pipeline \nspace hostage amount to \"nothing but conspiracy theories,\" she said. \n\t\tThe Assembly panel, however, concluded that both El Paso and Dynegy had \nmanipulated the market at an enormous cost to California consumers. \n\t\t\"The numbers tell the truth,\" the subcommittee said in a report obtained by \nThe Chronicle. \"The exorbitant prices cannot be defined away by regulators \nand bureaucrats, or explained away by corporate lawyers' wordplay.\" The \nreport was produced by three Assembly Democrats and two Republicans. \n\t\tWise, when he addresses the accusations, says he is mystified why state \nlawmakers are mad. He points to company plans to expand pipelines heading \nhere and to even build a power plant at San Francisco International Airport. \n\t\tWhen it comes to California, \"El Paso has always tried to be a part of the \nsolution, not the problem,\" he told a gas industry newsletter in December. \n\t\tState lawmakers' attempts to pry extensive hard numbers from El Paso have \nbeen met with resistance from the company, which calls them proprietary \ninformation. And judging by Morris' experience, chasing El Paso to the ground \nmay take the Legislature quite a while, if that's what it decides it wants to \ndo. \n\t\tMorris found that as he filed complaint after complaint against the company, \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would either rule against the PUC or \nput the filings off so long that they were moot when they came up. \n\t\tThe Assembly subcommittee's report was scathing in regard to the commission, \n\t\tsaying its approval of El Paso pipeline contracts \"raises serious questions \nabout whether it met its statutory duty under the federal Natural Gas Act to \nprotect consumers from unjust and unreasonable rates.\" \n\t\tThe commission did not send anyone to the Assembly hearings and has refused \nto comment on its rulings. \n\t\tBy the time the El Paso Merchant Energy contract expires May 31, opening the \ncrucial block of pipeline capacity to what critics say is true competition \nfor the first time in more than three years, it will be far too late, Morris \nsaid. \n\t\t\"The damage was done long ago,\" Morris said. The state and its utilities are \non the hook for billions in debt, money for last winter's bills has already \nleft consumers' pockets -- and regulators fear prices are unlikely to come \ndown soon. \n\t\t\"The market got set, and now we're in trouble,\" Morris said. -- -- -- \n\t\tPG&E, for its part, sees the whole mess through the eyes of a victim. \n\t\tThe utility had paid $560 million to hold its excess El Paso capacity from \n1993 to 1997, and the PUC had forbidden the company to recover $167 million \nof that through customer rates. And in 1996, the PUC and ratepayers were \nclamoring for lower power bills, and there was a huge amount of pipeline \nspace in the state that wasn't being used. \n\t\tSo when you're trying to cut costs, what better to cut than something you \ndon't need? said Dan Thomas, PG&E's director of gas transmission. \n\t\t\"I still think it was the right decision to relinquish the capacity,\" he \nsaid. \n\t\tStill, there's no denying the numbers. At latest count, PG&E owed El Paso \nmore than $150 million for gas and electricity. \n\t\tAs Morris sees it, El Paso is \"this big, 800-pound gorilla at the border and \ncan limit supplies as they wish. It's outrageous, and there wasn't a thing \nanybody could do to stop them.\" \n\t\tEl Paso officials, of course, put it differently. \n\t\t\"All we did was good business, smart business, and people keep dishing dirt \nabout us, but we just don't see ourselves in it,\" company spokesman Mel Scott \nsaid. \n\t\t\"It's pretty obvious to the analysts and to us that California set up this \nfaulty deregulation system, and if (PG&E and Southern California utilities) \nhad been in their right minds and signed up for long-term natural gas \ncontracts back in 1996 and 1997, they wouldn't be in this trouble.\" \n\t\tNobody official at El Paso is publicly gloating, but pleasure over the turn \nof events is never far from the surface. Those who can speak more freely \ndon't mind putting the boot in a bit. \n\t\t\"Everything bad that's happening right now (in the pipeline fight) could have \nbeen prevented if PG&E just hadn't gotten rid of that contract back then, \" \nWu said. \"But I have yet to hear anyone in this state say that. \n\t\t\"In fact, I have yet to hear anyone even at PG&E say that, and that's sad.\" \n\t\tWhat it all comes down to is this: El Paso figured out how to play \nCalifornia's energy game better than California. \n\t\t\"Those laws your boys passed there in California -- well, they just left you \nwide open to anyone who wanted to make an enormous profit,\" said Tom \"Smitty\" \nSmith, director of the Austin headquarters of Public Citizen, a consumer \nrights group. \n\t\t\"You can't fault the horse for eating hay when you lead it to the barn and \nput the bale right in front of its face, now can you?\" \nCalifornia's 'energy island' \n\t\tThere are just four points at the border where natural gas comes into \nenergy-starved California. The main one, owned by El Paso, is at the Colorado \nRiver. The pipelines originate in the Southwest. They wind 1,000 miles \nthrough several states to pop up right where Route 66 used to cut over the \nColorado River on its famous arched steel bridge. Today two of El Paso's \npipelines are all that use the old bridge. \n\t\t\n\nKenneth Shulklapper\nMedia Risk Management\nEnron Media Services\n(713) 853-7009 (phone)\n(713) 646-8436 (fax)"}

Plan\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII\nContent-Disposition: inline\nWednesday February 21, 11:21 am Eastern Time\nFERC Won't Reconsider PG&E Reorg. Plan\nBy Patrick Connole\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday \nupheld a plan by utility PG&E Corp (NYSE:PCG - news) to shield assets of its \nunregulated subsidiaries from creditors, denying objections raised by \nCalifornia state officials and by other companies.\nThe utility's plan, first approved by FERC last month, was widely seen as a \nway to protect some PG&E subsidiaries if the parent company was driven to \nbankruptcy by the California power crisis.\nPG&E and Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news), California's two biggest \nutilities, have been drained of billions of dollars by runaway wholesale \nprices for electricity. Under the state's 1996 deregulation law, the \ncompanies cannot pass through higher wholesale costs to consumers.\nOn Wednesday, FERC voted 2-to-1 at a regularly scheduled meeting to deny \nrequests for a rehearing on PG&E's plan.\nFERC said reorganization by PG&E -- which has annual revenues of more than \n$20 billion -- would promote construction of new power generating plants in \nthe energy-starved state.\nPG&E plans to create a limited-liability unit, NEG LLC, for its non-regulated \ncompanies. Included in the new unit will be Athens Generating Co., Badger \nGenerating Co., Hermiston Generating Co., Lake Road Generating Co., La Poloma \nGenerating Co., Liberty Generating Co., Madison Windpower, Mantua Creek \nGenerating Co., PG&E Dispersed Generating Co., PG&E Energy Trading-Power, \nPittsfield Generating Co., and USGen New England Inc.\n``This reorganization would insert NEG in the ownership chain between PG&E \nCorp and its direct, wholly-owned subsidiary NEG,'' FERC said in its order. \n``The stated purpose of this reorganization was to facilitate NEG's credit \nrating and future financings, either by NEG or on behalf of the \nsubsidiaries.''\nFERC rejected claims raised by California officials and companies that the \ncorporate reorganization plan would hurt competition.\n``There is only speculation that the transaction will increase the \npossibility of non-payment by PG&E and deter non-affiliate suppliers from \nselling power to PG&E, thus resulting in diminished power supplies in \nCalifornia,'' the FERC order said.\nThe majority of commissioners said they believed the opposite to be true.\n``By improving the ability of the NEG companies to obtain higher credit \nratings, the reorganization may increase the likelihood that lenders will \nfinance PG&E's electric generation construction projects in California,'' the \norder said.\nFERC also said the utility's financial problems pre-date the corporate \nreorganization.\nCommissioner William Massey voted in favor of a rehearing but was overruled \nby FERC chairman Curtis Hebert and Linda Breathitt. Massey previously \nobjected to PG&E's plan, expressing concern that such a corporate \nreorganization might hurt ratepayers and competitors.\nThe NEG LLC's companies are not subject to the Federal Power Act.\nCalifornia lawmakers have been trying to work out a detailed plan to provide \nimmediate and long-term relief to both utilities.\nFERC is a five-member independent agency that regulates interstate \nelectricity, natural gas and hydropower issues. Two seats are currently \nvacant.\n\n"}

Plan\nBy Patrick Connole\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday \nupheld a plan by utility PG&E Corp (NYSE:PCG - news) to shield assets of its \nunregulated subsidiaries from creditors, denying objections raised by \nCalifornia state officials and by other companies.\nThe utility's plan, first approved by FERC last month, was widely seen as a \nway to protect some PG&E subsidiaries if the parent company was driven to \nbankruptcy by the California power crisis.\nPG&E and Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news), California's two biggest \nutilities, have been drained of billions of dollars by runaway wholesale \nprices for electricity. Under the state's 1996 deregulation law, the \ncompanies cannot pass through higher wholesale costs to consumers.\nOn Wednesday, FERC voted 2-to-1 at a regularly scheduled meeting to deny \nrequests for a rehearing on PG&E's plan.\nFERC said reorganization by PG&E -- which has annual revenues of more than \n$20 billion -- would promote construction of new power generating plants in \nthe energy-starved state.\nPG&E plans to create a limited-liability unit, NEG LLC, for its non-regulated \ncompanies. Included in the new unit will be Athens Generating Co., Badger \nGenerating Co., Hermiston Generating Co., Lake Road Generating Co., La Poloma \nGenerating Co., Liberty Generating Co., Madison Windpower, Mantua Creek \nGenerating Co., PG&E Dispersed Generating Co., PG&E Energy Trading-Power, \nPittsfield Generating Co., and USGen New England Inc.\n``This reorganization would insert NEG in the ownership chain between PG&E \nCorp and its direct, wholly-owned subsidiary NEG,'' FERC said in its order. \n``The stated purpose of this reorganization was to facilitate NEG's credit \nrating and future financings, either by NEG or on behalf of the \nsubsidiaries.''\nFERC rejected claims raised by California officials and companies that the \ncorporate reorganization plan would hurt competition.\n``There is only speculation that the transaction will increase the \npossibility of non-payment by PG&E and deter non-affiliate suppliers from \nselling power to PG&E, thus resulting in diminished power supplies in \nCalifornia,'' the FERC order said.\nThe majority of commissioners said they believed the opposite to be true.\n``By improving the ability of the NEG companies to obtain higher credit \nratings, the reorganization may increase the likelihood that lenders will \nfinance PG&E's electric generation construction projects in California,'' the \norder said.\nFERC also said the utility's financial problems pre-date the corporate \nreorganization.\nCommissioner William Massey voted in favor of a rehearing but was overruled \nby FERC chairman Curtis Hebert and Linda Breathitt. Massey previously \nobjected to PG&E's plan, expressing concern that such a corporate \nreorganization might hurt ratepayers and competitors.\nThe NEG LLC's companies are not subject to the Federal Power Act.\nCalifornia lawmakers have been trying to work out a detailed plan to provide \nimmediate and long-term relief to both utilities.\nFERC is a five-member independent agency that regulates interstate \nelectricity, natural gas and hydropower issues. Two seats are currently \nvacant.\n\n"}

Plan\nBy Patrick Connole\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday \nupheld a plan by utility PG&E Corp (NYSE:PCG - news) to shield assets of its \nunregulated subsidiaries from creditors, denying objections raised by \nCalifornia state officials and by other companies.\nThe utility's plan, first approved by FERC last month, was widely seen as a \nway to protect some PG&E subsidiaries if the parent company was driven to \nbankruptcy by the California power crisis.\nPG&E and Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news), California's two biggest \nutilities, have been drained of billions of dollars by runaway wholesale \nprices for electricity. Under the state's 1996 deregulation law, the \ncompanies cannot pass through higher wholesale costs to consumers.\nOn Wednesday, FERC voted 2-to-1 at a regularly scheduled meeting to deny \nrequests for a rehearing on PG&E's plan.\nFERC said reorganization by PG&E -- which has annual revenues of more than \n$20 billion -- would promote construction of new power generating plants in \nthe energy-starved state.\nPG&E plans to create a limited-liability unit, NEG LLC, for its non-regulated \ncompanies. Included in the new unit will be Athens Generating Co., Badger \nGenerating Co., Hermiston Generating Co., Lake Road Generating Co., La Poloma \nGenerating Co., Liberty Generating Co., Madison Windpower, Mantua Creek \nGenerating Co., PG&E Dispersed Generating Co., PG&E Energy Trading-Power, \nPittsfield Generating Co., and USGen New England Inc.\n``This reorganization would insert NEG in the ownership chain between PG&E \nCorp and its direct, wholly-owned subsidiary NEG,'' FERC said in its order. \n``The stated purpose of this reorganization was to facilitate NEG's credit \nrating and future financings, either by NEG or on behalf of the \nsubsidiaries.''\nFERC rejected claims raised by California officials and companies that the \ncorporate reorganization plan would hurt competition.\n``There is only speculation that the transaction will increase the \npossibility of non-payment by PG&E and deter non-affiliate suppliers from \nselling power to PG&E, thus resulting in diminished power supplies in \nCalifornia,'' the FERC order said.\nThe majority of commissioners said they believed the opposite to be true.\n``By improving the ability of the NEG companies to obtain higher credit \nratings, the reorganization may increase the likelihood that lenders will \nfinance PG&E's electric generation construction projects in California,'' the \norder said.\nFERC also said the utility's financial problems pre-date the corporate \nreorganization.\nCommissioner William Massey voted in favor of a rehearing but was overruled \nby FERC chairman Curtis Hebert and Linda Breathitt. Massey previously \nobjected to PG&E's plan, expressing concern that such a corporate \nreorganization might hurt ratepayers and competitors.\nThe NEG LLC's companies are not subject to the Federal Power Act.\nCalifornia lawmakers have been trying to work out a detailed plan to provide \nimmediate and long-term relief to both utilities.\nFERC is a five-member independent agency that regulates interstate \nelectricity, natural gas and hydropower issues. Two seats are currently \nvacant.\n\n"}

While too much should never be read into a \ngrant of certiorari, this seems to be auspicious for Enron and to validate \nJoe's conclusion that it would be imprudent for Enron to rest on its victory \nin the court of appeals and not oppose proactively New York, et al. who are \nasking the Court to expand the native load exception.  It should also be \nnoted that the broadside against FERC's authority to act (the Dalton cert. \npetition), which Enron took the lead in opposing, was rejected outright.  \nEnron's brief is due in 45 days.

{"from": "Mike D Smith", "to": "Phillip K Allen", "content": "SCE's motion for preliminary injunction seeking an order permitting \nrecoupment of past and future undercollections was denied today.   It appears \nthat the case will now be scheduled for a future hearing after the parties \nhave had a chance to develop any relevant facts and fully brief the legal \nissues.  \nBelow is a summary of what occurred today: \n________________________________________________\n     Motion for Preliminary Injunction:  The Court denied SCE's Motion for a \nPreliminary Injunction on the merits.  Judge Lew stated that the Motion was \n\"wholly inappropriate\" and that granting it would violate the 11th \nAmendment.  The Court stated that mandatory injunctions, such as the one \nrequested here, are \"strongly disfavored\" and involve a heightened standard \nthat SCE failed to meet.  The Court also said it was constrained by the \nmatters put at issue in the pleadings, and that here the Motion sought relief \nin excess of that requested in the complaint.\n     While the Court let defense counsel argue for about 15-30 minutes, he \nmostly appeared disinterested in what they were saying.  Plaintiff's counsel \ndid not make any oral argument.\n    The Court also said that this case turns on the Pike County exception, \nwhich depends on whether there were alternative markets available; and that \nif the exception applies, there is no preemption claim.  The Court said that \nthere were certain narrow issues before it which is all that it will address, \nand that the Court is not a \"do it all\" problem solver for the parties.  The \nCourt did not indicate whether it was predisposed to rule for any side.\n     Motion for Order Specifying Facts without Substantial Controversy:  The \nCourt granted the motion as to facts 1-10, 12, and denied it as to facts 1, \n13.  The Court found that these particular facts were not substantially \ndisputed by the defendants, and that further discovery was not needed for the \nCourt to determine them. (Since I do not have a copy of the filings, I am \nunable to provide further comment.  Please let me know if you want me to \nobtain copies of the filings.)\n     Motions to Intervene:  The Court granted the Motions to Intervene \n(permissive intervention) filed by Los Angeles County and the Utility Reform \nNetwork on the ground that their participation would assist the court in \nhearing the complex matters presented.\n     Motion to Specially Appear:  The Court denied the California Attorney \nGeneral's motion to \"specially appear\" as inappropriate, but without \nprejudice to filing a motion for permissive intervention.\n     Criticism of Counsel:   The Judge castigated SCE's counsel in several \ninstances.  He called the preliminary injunction motion \"wholly \ninappropriate.\"  He criticized SCE's description in briefs of his ruling on \nJanuary 8, 2001, which the Judge said was \"flatly wrong.\"  (He said his \nJanuary 8 order did not hold that the filed rate doctrine permits the \nplaintiff to recover recoupment costs.)  With respect to the Motion for Order \nSpecifying Facts, he said he was \"not fooled\" by SCE's \"creative arguments.\"  \nThe Court also gave a general admonishment about \"spinning\" his rulings \noutside of the courtroom.  Reading between the lines, the Judge seemed \nbothered by media reports.  I do not know if the Judge was aware, but SCE had \na public relations person mingling in the court room with the many reporters \npresent.\n     Calendar:  The Court advanced the March 19, 2001 Scheduling Conference \nto March 5 at 9:00.  The Conference will address matters including discovery \npractice, motion deadlines and the trial date.  The Judge said he would \nconsider SCE's request for an early trial date.  However, he also said that \nit appeared that the primary disputed issues were legal, not factual, and \ntherefore he expected that summary judgment motions would be filed by both \nsides.\n     Consolidation with PG&E matter:  The Court initially expressed concern \nthat the PG&E case was transferred from Northern California, saying he had \ndoubts that this was the proper venue.  Later, however, the Judge seemed \nplacated when PG&E's counsel told him that the company had substantial assets \nin this district.  One counsel also told the Court that the parties had \nstipulated to consolidate the PG&E matter with the SCE matter, though the \nCourt did not say whether he would order consolidation.\n    Impression of Judge:  This was my first time observing Judge Lew.  He \nseems extremely strict, straightforward and no-nonsense.  He seemed very well \nprepared on the substance and not at all shy about ruling on the merits.  In \nthe SCE matter and preceding non-related matters, the Judge frequently \ncut-off counsel's arguments to focus on narrow issues of law, and made \ncounsel either answer very specific questions or stop talking completely.  \nHere, the Judge acknowledged this case's importance and said he does not take \nthis matter lightly.\n"}

{"from": "Mike D Smith", "to": "Phillip K Allen", "content": "SCE's motion for preliminary injunction seeking an order permitting \nrecoupment of past and future undercollections was denied today.   It appears \nthat the case will now be scheduled for a future hearing after the parties \nhave had a chance to develop any relevant facts and fully brief the legal \nissues.  \nBelow is a summary of what occurred today: \n________________________________________________\n     Motion for Preliminary Injunction:  The Court denied SCE's Motion for a \nPreliminary Injunction on the merits.  Judge Lew stated that the Motion was \n\"wholly inappropriate\" and that granting it would violate the 11th \nAmendment.  The Court stated that mandatory injunctions, such as the one \nrequested here, are \"strongly disfavored\" and involve a heightened standard \nthat SCE failed to meet.  The Court also said it was constrained by the \nmatters put at issue in the pleadings, and that here the Motion sought relief \nin excess of that requested in the complaint.\n     While the Court let defense counsel argue for about 15-30 minutes, he \nmostly appeared disinterested in what they were saying.  Plaintiff's counsel \ndid not make any oral argument.\n    The Court also said that this case turns on the Pike County exception, \nwhich depends on whether there were alternative markets available; and that \nif the exception applies, there is no preemption claim.  The Court said that \nthere were certain narrow issues before it which is all that it will address, \nand that the Court is not a \"do it all\" problem solver for the parties.  The \nCourt did not indicate whether it was predisposed to rule for any side.\n     Motion for Order Specifying Facts without Substantial Controversy:  The \nCourt granted the motion as to facts 1-10, 12, and denied it as to facts 1, \n13.  The Court found that these particular facts were not substantially \ndisputed by the defendants, and that further discovery was not needed for the \nCourt to determine them. (Since I do not have a copy of the filings, I am \nunable to provide further comment.  Please let me know if you want me to \nobtain copies of the filings.)\n     Motions to Intervene:  The Court granted the Motions to Intervene \n(permissive intervention) filed by Los Angeles County and the Utility Reform \nNetwork on the ground that their participation would assist the court in \nhearing the complex matters presented.\n     Motion to Specially Appear:  The Court denied the California Attorney \nGeneral's motion to \"specially appear\" as inappropriate, but without \nprejudice to filing a motion for permissive intervention.\n     Criticism of Counsel:   The Judge castigated SCE's counsel in several \ninstances.  He called the preliminary injunction motion \"wholly \ninappropriate.\"  He criticized SCE's description in briefs of his ruling on \nJanuary 8, 2001, which the Judge said was \"flatly wrong.\"  (He said his \nJanuary 8 order did not hold that the filed rate doctrine permits the \nplaintiff to recover recoupment costs.)  With respect to the Motion for Order \nSpecifying Facts, he said he was \"not fooled\" by SCE's \"creative arguments.\"  \nThe Court also gave a general admonishment about \"spinning\" his rulings \noutside of the courtroom.  Reading between the lines, the Judge seemed \nbothered by media reports.  I do not know if the Judge was aware, but SCE had \na public relations person mingling in the court room with the many reporters \npresent.\n     Calendar:  The Court advanced the March 19, 2001 Scheduling Conference \nto March 5 at 9:00.  The Conference will address matters including discovery \npractice, motion deadlines and the trial date.  The Judge said he would \nconsider SCE's request for an early trial date.  However, he also said that \nit appeared that the primary disputed issues were legal, not factual, and \ntherefore he expected that summary judgment motions would be filed by both \nsides.\n     Consolidation with PG&E matter:  The Court initially expressed concern \nthat the PG&E case was transferred from Northern California, saying he had \ndoubts that this was the proper venue.  Later, however, the Judge seemed \nplacated when PG&E's counsel told him that the company had substantial assets \nin this district.  One counsel also told the Court that the parties had \nstipulated to consolidate the PG&E matter with the SCE matter, though the \nCourt did not say whether he would order consolidation.\n    Impression of Judge:  This was my first time observing Judge Lew.  He \nseems extremely strict, straightforward and no-nonsense.  He seemed very well \nprepared on the substance and not at all shy about ruling on the merits.  In \nthe SCE matter and preceding non-related matters, the Judge frequently \ncut-off counsel's arguments to focus on narrow issues of law, and made \ncounsel either answer very specific questions or stop talking completely.  \nHere, the Judge acknowledged this case's importance and said he does not take \nthis matter lightly.\n"}

{"from": "Mike D Smith", "to": "Phillip K Allen", "content": "SCE's motion for preliminary injunction seeking an order permitting \nrecoupment of past and future undercollections was denied today.   It appears \nthat the case will now be scheduled for a future hearing after the parties \nhave had a chance to develop any relevant facts and fully brief the legal \nissues.  \nBelow is a summary of what occurred today: \n________________________________________________\n     Motion for Preliminary Injunction:  The Court denied SCE's Motion for a \nPreliminary Injunction on the merits.  Judge Lew stated that the Motion was \n\"wholly inappropriate\" and that granting it would violate the 11th \nAmendment.  The Court stated that mandatory injunctions, such as the one \nrequested here, are \"strongly disfavored\" and involve a heightened standard \nthat SCE failed to meet.  The Court also said it was constrained by the \nmatters put at issue in the pleadings, and that here the Motion sought relief \nin excess of that requested in the complaint.\n     While the Court let defense counsel argue for about 15-30 minutes, he \nmostly appeared disinterested in what they were saying.  Plaintiff's counsel \ndid not make any oral argument.\n    The Court also said that this case turns on the Pike County exception, \nwhich depends on whether there were alternative markets available; and that \nif the exception applies, there is no preemption claim.  The Court said that \nthere were certain narrow issues before it which is all that it will address, \nand that the Court is not a \"do it all\" problem solver for the parties.  The \nCourt did not indicate whether it was predisposed to rule for any side.\n     Motion for Order Specifying Facts without Substantial Controversy:  The \nCourt granted the motion as to facts 1-10, 12, and denied it as to facts 1, \n13.  The Court found that these particular facts were not substantially \ndisputed by the defendants, and that further discovery was not needed for the \nCourt to determine them. (Since I do not have a copy of the filings, I am \nunable to provide further comment.  Please let me know if you want me to \nobtain copies of the filings.)\n     Motions to Intervene:  The Court granted the Motions to Intervene \n(permissive intervention) filed by Los Angeles County and the Utility Reform \nNetwork on the ground that their participation would assist the court in \nhearing the complex matters presented.\n     Motion to Specially Appear:  The Court denied the California Attorney \nGeneral's motion to \"specially appear\" as inappropriate, but without \nprejudice to filing a motion for permissive intervention.\n     Criticism of Counsel:   The Judge castigated SCE's counsel in several \ninstances.  He called the preliminary injunction motion \"wholly \ninappropriate.\"  He criticized SCE's description in briefs of his ruling on \nJanuary 8, 2001, which the Judge said was \"flatly wrong.\"  (He said his \nJanuary 8 order did not hold that the filed rate doctrine permits the \nplaintiff to recover recoupment costs.)  With respect to the Motion for Order \nSpecifying Facts, he said he was \"not fooled\" by SCE's \"creative arguments.\"  \nThe Court also gave a general admonishment about \"spinning\" his rulings \noutside of the courtroom.  Reading between the lines, the Judge seemed \nbothered by media reports.  I do not know if the Judge was aware, but SCE had \na public relations person mingling in the court room with the many reporters \npresent.\n     Calendar:  The Court advanced the March 19, 2001 Scheduling Conference \nto March 5 at 9:00.  The Conference will address matters including discovery \npractice, motion deadlines and the trial date.  The Judge said he would \nconsider SCE's request for an early trial date.  However, he also said that \nit appeared that the primary disputed issues were legal, not factual, and \ntherefore he expected that summary judgment motions would be filed by both \nsides.\n     Consolidation with PG&E matter:  The Court initially expressed concern \nthat the PG&E case was transferred from Northern California, saying he had \ndoubts that this was the proper venue.  Later, however, the Judge seemed \nplacated when PG&E's counsel told him that the company had substantial assets \nin this district.  One counsel also told the Court that the parties had \nstipulated to consolidate the PG&E matter with the SCE matter, though the \nCourt did not say whether he would order consolidation.\n    Impression of Judge:  This was my first time observing Judge Lew.  He \nseems extremely strict, straightforward and no-nonsense.  He seemed very well \nprepared on the substance and not at all shy about ruling on the merits.  In \nthe SCE matter and preceding non-related matters, the Judge frequently \ncut-off counsel's arguments to focus on narrow issues of law, and made \ncounsel either answer very specific questions or stop talking completely.  \nHere, the Judge acknowledged this case's importance and said he does not take \nthis matter lightly.\n"}

{"from": "Mike D Smith", "to": "Phillip K Allen", "content": "SCE's motion for preliminary injunction seeking an order permitting \nrecoupment of past and future undercollections was denied today.   It appears \nthat the case will now be scheduled for a future hearing after the parties \nhave had a chance to develop any relevant facts and fully brief the legal \nissues.  \nBelow is a summary of what occurred today: \n________________________________________________\n     Motion for Preliminary Injunction:  The Court denied SCE's Motion for a \nPreliminary Injunction on the merits.  Judge Lew stated that the Motion was \n\"wholly inappropriate\" and that granting it would violate the 11th \nAmendment.  The Court stated that mandatory injunctions, such as the one \nrequested here, are \"strongly disfavored\" and involve a heightened standard \nthat SCE failed to meet.  The Court also said it was constrained by the \nmatters put at issue in the pleadings, and that here the Motion sought relief \nin excess of that requested in the complaint.\n     While the Court let defense counsel argue for about 15-30 minutes, he \nmostly appeared disinterested in what they were saying.  Plaintiff's counsel \ndid not make any oral argument.\n    The Court also said that this case turns on the Pike County exception, \nwhich depends on whether there were alternative markets available; and that \nif the exception applies, there is no preemption claim.  The Court said that \nthere were certain narrow issues before it which is all that it will address, \nand that the Court is not a \"do it all\" problem solver for the parties.  The \nCourt did not indicate whether it was predisposed to rule for any side.\n     Motion for Order Specifying Facts without Substantial Controversy:  The \nCourt granted the motion as to facts 1-10, 12, and denied it as to facts 1, \n13.  The Court found that these particular facts were not substantially \ndisputed by the defendants, and that further discovery was not needed for the \nCourt to determine them. (Since I do not have a copy of the filings, I am \nunable to provide further comment.  Please let me know if you want me to \nobtain copies of the filings.)\n     Motions to Intervene:  The Court granted the Motions to Intervene \n(permissive intervention) filed by Los Angeles County and the Utility Reform \nNetwork on the ground that their participation would assist the court in \nhearing the complex matters presented.\n     Motion to Specially Appear:  The Court denied the California Attorney \nGeneral's motion to \"specially appear\" as inappropriate, but without \nprejudice to filing a motion for permissive intervention.\n     Criticism of Counsel:   The Judge castigated SCE's counsel in several \ninstances.  He called the preliminary injunction motion \"wholly \ninappropriate.\"  He criticized SCE's description in briefs of his ruling on \nJanuary 8, 2001, which the Judge said was \"flatly wrong.\"  (He said his \nJanuary 8 order did not hold that the filed rate doctrine permits the \nplaintiff to recover recoupment costs.)  With respect to the Motion for Order \nSpecifying Facts, he said he was \"not fooled\" by SCE's \"creative arguments.\"  \nThe Court also gave a general admonishment about \"spinning\" his rulings \noutside of the courtroom.  Reading between the lines, the Judge seemed \nbothered by media reports.  I do not know if the Judge was aware, but SCE had \na public relations person mingling in the court room with the many reporters \npresent.\n     Calendar:  The Court advanced the March 19, 2001 Scheduling Conference \nto March 5 at 9:00.  The Conference will address matters including discovery \npractice, motion deadlines and the trial date.  The Judge said he would \nconsider SCE's request for an early trial date.  However, he also said that \nit appeared that the primary disputed issues were legal, not factual, and \ntherefore he expected that summary judgment motions would be filed by both \nsides.\n     Consolidation with PG&E matter:  The Court initially expressed concern \nthat the PG&E case was transferred from Northern California, saying he had \ndoubts that this was the proper venue.  Later, however, the Judge seemed \nplacated when PG&E's counsel told him that the company had substantial assets \nin this district.  One counsel also told the Court that the parties had \nstipulated to consolidate the PG&E matter with the SCE matter, though the \nCourt did not say whether he would order consolidation.\n    Impression of Judge:  This was my first time observing Judge Lew.  He \nseems extremely strict, straightforward and no-nonsense.  He seemed very well \nprepared on the substance and not at all shy about ruling on the merits.  In \nthe SCE matter and preceding non-related matters, the Judge frequently \ncut-off counsel's arguments to focus on narrow issues of law, and made \ncounsel either answer very specific questions or stop talking completely.  \nHere, the Judge acknowledged this case's importance and said he does not take \nthis matter lightly.\n"}

{"from": "Mike D Smith", "to": "Phillip K Allen", "content": "SCE's motion for preliminary injunction seeking an order permitting \nrecoupment of past and future undercollections was denied today.   It appears \nthat the case will now be scheduled for a future hearing after the parties \nhave had a chance to develop any relevant facts and fully brief the legal \nissues.  \nBelow is a summary of what occurred today: \n________________________________________________\n     Motion for Preliminary Injunction:  The Court denied SCE's Motion for a \nPreliminary Injunction on the merits.  Judge Lew stated that the Motion was \n\"wholly inappropriate\" and that granting it would violate the 11th \nAmendment.  The Court stated that mandatory injunctions, such as the one \nrequested here, are \"strongly disfavored\" and involve a heightened standard \nthat SCE failed to meet.  The Court also said it was constrained by the \nmatters put at issue in the pleadings, and that here the Motion sought relief \nin excess of that requested in the complaint.\n     While the Court let defense counsel argue for about 15-30 minutes, he \nmostly appeared disinterested in what they were saying.  Plaintiff's counsel \ndid not make any oral argument.\n    The Court also said that this case turns on the Pike County exception, \nwhich depends on whether there were alternative markets available; and that \nif the exception applies, there is no preemption claim.  The Court said that \nthere were certain narrow issues before it which is all that it will address, \nand that the Court is not a \"do it all\" problem solver for the parties.  The \nCourt did not indicate whether it was predisposed to rule for any side.\n     Motion for Order Specifying Facts without Substantial Controversy:  The \nCourt granted the motion as to facts 1-10, 12, and denied it as to facts 1, \n13.  The Court found that these particular facts were not substantially \ndisputed by the defendants, and that further discovery was not needed for the \nCourt to determine them. (Since I do not have a copy of the filings, I am \nunable to provide further comment.  Please let me know if you want me to \nobtain copies of the filings.)\n     Motions to Intervene:  The Court granted the Motions to Intervene \n(permissive intervention) filed by Los Angeles County and the Utility Reform \nNetwork on the ground that their participation would assist the court in \nhearing the complex matters presented.\n     Motion to Specially Appear:  The Court denied the California Attorney \nGeneral's motion to \"specially appear\" as inappropriate, but without \nprejudice to filing a motion for permissive intervention.\n     Criticism of Counsel:   The Judge castigated SCE's counsel in several \ninstances.  He called the preliminary injunction motion \"wholly \ninappropriate.\"  He criticized SCE's description in briefs of his ruling on \nJanuary 8, 2001, which the Judge said was \"flatly wrong.\"  (He said his \nJanuary 8 order did not hold that the filed rate doctrine permits the \nplaintiff to recover recoupment costs.)  With respect to the Motion for Order \nSpecifying Facts, he said he was \"not fooled\" by SCE's \"creative arguments.\"  \nThe Court also gave a general admonishment about \"spinning\" his rulings \noutside of the courtroom.  Reading between the lines, the Judge seemed \nbothered by media reports.  I do not know if the Judge was aware, but SCE had \na public relations person mingling in the court room with the many reporters \npresent.\n     Calendar:  The Court advanced the March 19, 2001 Scheduling Conference \nto March 5 at 9:00.  The Conference will address matters including discovery \npractice, motion deadlines and the trial date.  The Judge said he would \nconsider SCE's request for an early trial date.  However, he also said that \nit appeared that the primary disputed issues were legal, not factual, and \ntherefore he expected that summary judgment motions would be filed by both \nsides.\n     Consolidation with PG&E matter:  The Court initially expressed concern \nthat the PG&E case was transferred from Northern California, saying he had \ndoubts that this was the proper venue.  Later, however, the Judge seemed \nplacated when PG&E's counsel told him that the company had substantial assets \nin this district.  One counsel also told the Court that the parties had \nstipulated to consolidate the PG&E matter with the SCE matter, though the \nCourt did not say whether he would order consolidation.\n    Impression of Judge:  This was my first time observing Judge Lew.  He \nseems extremely strict, straightforward and no-nonsense.  He seemed very well \nprepared on the substance and not at all shy about ruling on the merits.  In \nthe SCE matter and preceding non-related matters, the Judge frequently \ncut-off counsel's arguments to focus on narrow issues of law, and made \ncounsel either answer very specific questions or stop talking completely.  \nHere, the Judge acknowledged this case's importance and said he does not take \nthis matter lightly.\n"}

For those of us who \nbelieve that as an unquestioned article of faith, let me  give you a little \nhistory lesson. You'll see that it can get a lot worse  than this.\nFor our little history lesson we'll focus on the S&P 500, because that  \npretty much represents the entire US equity market. Obviously the NASDAQ has \nhad  it a lot worse -- but that's only a subset of the total market, and it's \nfairly  concentrated in a single broad sector: technology. In subsequent \ncommentaries  the NASDAQ will get its turn in the historical spotlight.\nOver the last two quarters  the S&P 500 lost 19.23%.

But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns \nthat  an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is \nputting the  reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. \nThat's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S.  \nburn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able \nto  shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were  \nconstructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel  \nflexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than \ngas  and generally has been costlier. \nIn California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San  \nDiego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to \ngrow  new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical \nemergencies last  summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had \nhoped to solve the  problem by speeding up construction of new generating \nplants. Now, they're  finding the state may be building its way out of an \nelectrical problem and into  a gas problem. \nOne official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single  \nfuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a  \ncomprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas \nand  electricity affect each other. \"We don't just need new generating plants \nand  transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too,\" said Terry Winter, \nchief  executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the  \norganization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies. \"You  \ncan't look at these things in isolation.\" \nThe natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,  \nSan Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful  \nof industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. \nIn  California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural \ngas,  and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are \ngenerating  plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns  \nsome of the older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. \nBut  it didn't like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution \nwhen  they burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that \npower  plants here need to operate. \nThe San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was \nshort  of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, \nincluding  many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now \nundergoing repair  after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer. \nWhat's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough \nto  begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers \nand  not big power plants. \nThe problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because  \ngas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, \nbut  especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard \nlast  summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic \nfeet of  gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% \nless. Prices  also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million \nBritish thermal units  to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are \ndown about 8% from a year  ago. \n\"Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation,\" said  \nJohn Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of \nEnron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up  in the Northeast, \nbased on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two  weeks. \nHigh prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. \nIn  California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was \n$228  per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times \nthe price a  year earlier. \n"}

But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns \nthat  an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is \nputting the  reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. \nThat's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S.  \nburn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able \nto  shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were  \nconstructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel  \nflexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than \ngas  and generally has been costlier. \nIn California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San  \nDiego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to \ngrow  new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical \nemergencies last  summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had \nhoped to solve the  problem by speeding up construction of new generating \nplants. Now, they're  finding the state may be building its way out of an \nelectrical problem and into  a gas problem. \nOne official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single  \nfuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a  \ncomprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas \nand  electricity affect each other. \"We don't just need new generating plants \nand  transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too,\" said Terry Winter, \nchief  executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the  \norganization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies. \"You  \ncan't look at these things in isolation.\" \nThe natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,  \nSan Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful  \nof industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. \nIn  California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural \ngas,  and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are \ngenerating  plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns  \nsome of the older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. \nBut  it didn't like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution \nwhen  they burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that \npower  plants here need to operate. \nThe San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was \nshort  of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, \nincluding  many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now \nundergoing repair  after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer. \nWhat's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough \nto  begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers \nand  not big power plants. \nThe problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because  \ngas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, \nbut  especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard \nlast  summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic \nfeet of  gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% \nless. Prices  also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million \nBritish thermal units  to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are \ndown about 8% from a year  ago. \n\"Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation,\" said  \nJohn Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of \nEnron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up  in the Northeast, \nbased on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two  weeks. \nHigh prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. \nIn  California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was \n$228  per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times \nthe price a  year earlier. \n"}

But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns \nthat  an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is \nputting the  reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. \nThat's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S.  \nburn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able \nto  shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were  \nconstructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel  \nflexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than \ngas  and generally has been costlier. \nIn California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San  \nDiego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to \ngrow  new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical \nemergencies last  summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had \nhoped to solve the  problem by speeding up construction of new generating \nplants. Now, they're  finding the state may be building its way out of an \nelectrical problem and into  a gas problem. \nOne official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single  \nfuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a  \ncomprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas \nand  electricity affect each other. \"We don't just need new generating plants \nand  transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too,\" said Terry Winter, \nchief  executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the  \norganization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies. \"You  \ncan't look at these things in isolation.\" \nThe natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,  \nSan Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful  \nof industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. \nIn  California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural \ngas,  and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are \ngenerating  plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns  \nsome of the older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. \nBut  it didn't like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution \nwhen  they burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that \npower  plants here need to operate. \nThe San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was \nshort  of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, \nincluding  many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now \nundergoing repair  after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer. \nWhat's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough \nto  begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers \nand  not big power plants. \nThe problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because  \ngas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, \nbut  especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard \nlast  summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic \nfeet of  gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% \nless. Prices  also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million \nBritish thermal units  to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are \ndown about 8% from a year  ago. \n\"Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation,\" said  \nJohn Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of \nEnron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up  in the Northeast, \nbased on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two  weeks. \nHigh prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. \nIn  California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was \n$228  per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times \nthe price a  year earlier. \n"}

For those of us who \nbelieve that as an unquestioned article of faith, let me  give you a little \nhistory lesson. You'll see that it can get a lot worse  than this.\nFor our little history lesson we'll focus on the S&P 500, because that  \npretty much represents the entire US equity market. Obviously the NASDAQ has \nhad  it a lot worse -- but that's only a subset of the total market, and it's \nfairly  concentrated in a single broad sector: technology. In subsequent \ncommentaries  the NASDAQ will get its turn in the historical spotlight.\nOver the last two quarters  the S&P 500 lost 19.23%. As horrific as that has \nbeen, that actually only  ranks 78th out of the 2409 six-month periods since \n1800. Believe it or not,  there have been 77 that were worse.\nThere were eight six-month  periods in which the S&P 500 lost more than 40%. \nThere were 18 in which it  lost more than 30%. The very worst single \nsix-month period was the one ending  May, 1932, in which the S&P 500 lost an \nastonishing 52.92%.\nOf the 77 six-month periods  worse than the most recent one, 21 were before \n1900, and none of them were  during the Civil War. 33 (including the very \nworst 4) were in the 1930s, in the  Great Depression that followed in the \nwake of the stock market crash of 1929.  \nThe worst six-month period  in the modern era ranks 13th overall. It was the \none ended September, 1974, with  the S&P down 32.39%. 4 others were in the \n1970s. \nThe most recent period worse  than the last six months ranks 73rd. It was the \none ended March, 1988, with the  S&P down 19.56%. That means that in the \n1990s there were no six-month  periods worse than the most recent six-month \nperiod. \nThis shows that what we've experienced over the last six months is by no  \nmeans as bad as it could have been, or could still be. But at the same time \nit  shows that market performance this bad is extremely rare. The S&P 500 \nhas  done this badly (or worse) only 3.2% of the time over a span of 200 \nyears. But  don't let any of that make you think it can't get worse. \nIt can. Of the 77 six-month periods worse than the most recent, the S&P  went \ndown further during the next six months 24 times -- losing an  average of an \nadditional 18.24%. \nOkay, so the bad news is that, based on history, we've got about a 1/3 \nchance  of things still getting worse over the next six months. But of course \nthe good  news is that we've got, on the same basis, a 2/3 chance of things \ngetting  better. \nBut not that much better. Over the 53 times the S&P rose over the  next six \nmonths, it only rose an average of 18.38%. Even if that happens now  over the \ncoming six months, that's not going to make up for the 19.23% loss of  the \nlast six months. And don't forget about the bad magic of compounding losses.  \nIf you start with a dollar and you lose 19.23% of it, you've got 80.8 cents  \nleft. It that then rises by 18.38%, you're only back up to 95.6 cents. \nHistory class dismissed. Oh, and there will be a test tomorrow... (and every  \nday). \n - TOP.GIF\n - BOTTOM.GIF\n - audio.gif\n - vid.gif\n"}

But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns \nthat  an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is \nputting the  reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. \nThat's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S.  \nburn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able \nto  shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were  \nconstructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel  \nflexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than \ngas  and generally has been costlier. \nIn California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San  \nDiego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to \ngrow  new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical \nemergencies last  summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had \nhoped to solve the  problem by speeding up construction of new generating \nplants. Now, they're  finding the state may be building its way out of an \nelectrical problem and into  a gas problem. \nOne official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single  \nfuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a  \ncomprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas \nand  electricity affect each other. \"We don't just need new generating plants \nand  transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too,\" said Terry Winter, \nchief  executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the  \norganization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies. \"You  \ncan't look at these things in isolation.\" \nThe natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,  \nSan Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful  \nof industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. \nIn  California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural \ngas,  and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are \ngenerating  plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns  \nsome of the older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. \nBut  it didn't like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution \nwhen  they burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that \npower  plants here need to operate. \nThe San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was \nshort  of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, \nincluding  many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now \nundergoing repair  after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer. \nWhat's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough \nto  begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers \nand  not big power plants. \nThe problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because  \ngas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, \nbut  especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard \nlast  summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic \nfeet of  gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% \nless. Prices  also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million \nBritish thermal units  to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are \ndown about 8% from a year  ago. \n\"Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation,\" said  \nJohn Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of \nEnron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up  in the Northeast, \nbased on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two  weeks. \nHigh prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. \nIn  California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was \n$228  per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times \nthe price a  year earlier. \n"}

Believe it or not,  there have been 77 that were worse.\nThere were eight six-month  periods in which the S&P 500 lost more than 40%. \nThere were 18 in which it  lost more than 30%. The very worst single \nsix-month period was the one ending  May, 1932, in which the S&P 500 lost an \nastonishing 52.92%.\nOf the 77 six-month periods  worse than the most recent one, 21 were before \n1900, and none of them were  during the Civil War. 33 (including the very \nworst 4) were in the 1930s, in the  Great Depression that followed in the \nwake of the stock market crash of 1929.  \nThe worst six-month period  in the modern era ranks 13th overall. It was the \none ended September, 1974, with  the S&P down 32.39%. 4 others were in the \n1970s. \nThe most recent period worse  than the last six months ranks 73rd. It was the \none ended March, 1988, with the  S&P down 19.56%. That means that in the \n1990s there were no six-month  periods worse than the most recent six-month \nperiod. \nThis shows that what we've experienced over the last six months is by no  \nmeans as bad as it could have been, or could still be. But at the same time \nit  shows that market performance this bad is extremely rare. The S&P 500 \nhas  done this badly (or worse) only 3.2% of the time over a span of 200 \nyears. But  don't let any of that make you think it can't get worse. \nIt can. Of the 77 six-month periods worse than the most recent, the S&P  went \ndown further during the next six months 24 times -- losing an  average of an \nadditional 18.24%. \nOkay, so the bad news is that, based on history, we've got about a 1/3 \nchance  of things still getting worse over the next six months. But of course \nthe good  news is that we've got, on the same basis, a 2/3 chance of things \ngetting  better. \nBut not that much better. Over the 53 times the S&P rose over the  next six \nmonths, it only rose an average of 18.38%. Even if that happens now  over the \ncoming six months, that's not going to make up for the 19.23% loss of  the \nlast six months. And don't forget about the bad magic of compounding losses.  \nIf you start with a dollar and you lose 19.23% of it, you've got 80.8 cents  \nleft. It that then rises by 18.38%, you're only back up to 95.6 cents. \nHistory class dismissed. Oh, and there will be a test tomorrow... (and every  \nday). \n - TOP.GIF\n - BOTTOM.GIF\n - audio.gif\n - vid.gif\n"}

{"from": "Jane M Tholt", "to": "Phillip K Allen", "content": "Below is a summary of the discussions last week regarding the complaint \nagainst El Paso for oversubscribing the Socal Topock Point.\nThe meeting started out by summarizing the dollar impact of the Border cuts \nto Amoco and Burlington of $3 million dollars and the additional fuel costs  \nof $15 million that they have incurred when the mainline fuel was reduced and \nthe gathering fuel was increased.  Accordingly, producers are seeking a \nminimum of $17  million in compensation in some form or  another.\nThe biggest concern is that a total of 1.2 bcf/day is being nominated at the \nSocal Topock which can only deliver 540000 mmbtu/day.   Socal Gas stated that \nthis problem should go away when there system becomes unbundled (referred to \nas Gatekeeper)..  The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could \nbe implemented as early as October 1, 2001.  When the Gatekeeper is \nimplemented  , only 540000 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the Socal Topock \nborder and must match up with the intra-state transport.  \nSoCal Gas suggested taking the 1.2 bcf/day of nominations at the Topock \ndelivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the \ncapapcity-  400 to Mohave; 540 to Socal Topock;  and 180 to PGE Topock.  They \nalso stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but  needed a minimum \nof 300 to meet core needs.  However, they wanted some type of compensation if \ntheir volume was reduced.   They also agreed to live with the status quo \nuntil the Gatekeeper was implemented.  This would result in firm rights being \nestablished at Socal Topock based on downstream rights.\nWilliams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a \nreduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment.\nAfter much discussion,  El Paso came back with the following counter proposal:\nRecommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented.  Does not \nrelate to receipt point rights.\n1)  Block 1 Capacity will always be alternate to Socal Topock (198000);\n2)Block II Capacity can not be sold at PGE Topock (614000)\n3) Amoco and OneOk each have a contract 45000/d which can go to Topock or \nEhrenberg.  It is recommended that they\n give up their Ehrenberg right and keep Topock right and Socal will give up \nlike amount at Topock as well as shift an additional  70000 mmbtu/day from \nTopock to Ehrenberg resulting in approx. 115000 being shifted  to Ehrenberg.\n4) Rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows:\n   Socal Topock   PGE/Mohave Topock\nTexaco   40    135\nBurlington  26    74\nAero   5    15\nBorax   7    12\nLADWP  0    36\nSWGas   0    20\n5) Socal Topock would now be divided as follows:\nExpansion Shippers  78000 \nSocal Gas           425000\nBLK 3                               348000 (25-Amoco;20-Oneok;99-Williams;189 \nEl Paso Merchant;15-Wlliams)\nTotal 851000\n540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts or 63 percent thruput.\nThe producers were not happy with having to live with 37 percent cuts and \nfelt that any transport sold after their Sept 28 complaint should be cut off \nthe top which would be El Paso merchant services Blk 3.\nSeparate meetings were then held amongst the Topock shippers to duscuss El \nPaso's counter -proposal.  \nProducer group came back and told El Paso that they want the 63 percent \nthruput increased.  Will accept CD reduction, rate design change or other \nforms of compensation.   For  the recommended volumes moved to Mohave/Pge \nTopock, they would consider a 30 percent reduction in CD demand as well as \nconverting that path to a 100 volumetric rate.  In other words, if the \nproducers used the delivery point, they would pay max rate.  If they did not, \nthey would not pay anything.\nBlock 3 shippers would agree to reduce deliveries to Socal Topock if their \ndeals were converted to an agreed upon load factor-maybe 70 percent.  For \nvolumes shifted to non-Socal Points , they also want a 100 percent volumetric \nrate.\nBottom-line is  how much dollars is El Paso willing to pay to resolve this \ncase.  Each party is requested to submit a proposal to El Paso and they will \nstudy  its entirety.  No follow-up meeting was scheduled.\nAnother topic that was also being discussed at the meeting was the perceived \ngaming on the system by the full-requirements customers-ie nominating more \ngas than they need in anticipation of cuts.  It is thought that if this could \nbe controlled there may be more certainty in the san juan regarding flows.  \nEl Paso recommended the following :  Limit noms on Cycle 1 from San Juan \nbased on previous day's  total nom from all basins.   No limits on Cycle \n2-4.  This caused some concerns because of week-end load swings \nandfluctuatingpower-plant loads.  However, eoc's were willing to establish a \ntechnical committee to work on a formula if theSocal Topock point gets \nresolved.\nRegarding pooling, El Paso is proposing to add 8 additional pools in the \nkeystone and 3 additonal pools in the san juan and 1 additional pool in the \nbondad.  This process is in its early stages of conflict.  Most people (Duke, \nSouthern, Williams, Coral)  are not on board with this.  I will keep you \nadvised of development.  Please advise if you have any questions.\n\n"}

The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could \nbe implemented as early as October 1, 2001.  When the Gatekeeper is \nimplemented  , only 540000 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the Socal Topock \nborder and must match up with the intra-state transport.  \nSoCal Gas suggested taking the 1.2 bcf/day of nominations at the Topock \ndelivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the \ncapapcity-  400 to Mohave; 540 to Socal Topock;  and 180 to PGE Topock.  They \nalso stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but  needed a minimum \nof 300 to meet core needs.  However, they wanted some type of compensation if \ntheir volume was reduced.   They also agreed to live with the status quo \nuntil the Gatekeeper was implemented.  This would result in firm rights being \nestablished at Socal Topock based on downstream rights.\nWilliams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a \nreduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment.\nAfter much discussion,  El Paso came back with the following counter proposal:\nRecommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented.  Does not \nrelate to receipt point rights.\n1)  Block 1 Capacity will always be alternate to Socal Topock (198000);\n2)Block II Capacity can not be sold at PGE Topock (614000)\n3) Amoco and OneOk each have a contract 45000/d which can go to Topock or \nEhrenberg.  It is recommended that they\n give up their Ehrenberg right and keep Topock right and Socal will give up \nlike amount at Topock as well as shift an additional  70000 mmbtu/day from \nTopock to Ehrenberg resulting in approx. 115000 being shifted  to Ehrenberg.\n4) Rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows:\n   Socal Topock   PGE/Mohave Topock\nTexaco   40    135\nBurlington  26    74\nAero   5    15\nBorax   7    12\nLADWP  0    36\nSWGas   0    20\n5) Socal Topock would now be divided as follows:\nExpansion Shippers  78000 \nSocal Gas           425000\nBLK 3                               348000 (25-Amoco;20-Oneok;99-Williams;189 \nEl Paso Merchant;15-Wlliams)\nTotal 851000\n540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts or 63 percent thruput.\nThe producers were not happy with having to live with 37 percent cuts and \nfelt that any transport sold after their Sept 28 complaint should be cut off \nthe top which would be El Paso merchant services Blk 3.\nSeparate meetings were then held amongst the Topock shippers to duscuss El \nPaso's counter -proposal.  \nProducer group came back and told El Paso that they want the 63 percent \nthruput increased.  Will accept CD reduction, rate design change or other \nforms of compensation.   For  the recommended volumes moved to Mohave/Pge \nTopock, they would consider a 30 percent reduction in CD demand as well as \nconverting that path to a 100 volumetric rate.  In other words, if the \nproducers used the delivery point, they would pay max rate.  If they did not, \nthey would not pay anything.\nBlock 3 shippers would agree to reduce deliveries to Socal Topock if their \ndeals were converted to an agreed upon load factor-maybe 70 percent.  For \nvolumes shifted to non-Socal Points , they also want a 100 percent volumetric \nrate.\nBottom-line is  how much dollars is El Paso willing to pay to resolve this \ncase.  Each party is requested to submit a proposal to El Paso and they will \nstudy  its entirety.  No follow-up meeting was scheduled.\nAnother topic that was also being discussed at the meeting was the perceived \ngaming on the system by the full-requirements customers-ie nominating more \ngas than they need in anticipation of cuts.  It is thought that if this could \nbe controlled there may be more certainty in the san juan regarding flows.  \nEl Paso recommended the following :  Limit noms on Cycle 1 from San Juan \nbased on previous day's  total nom from all basins.   No limits on Cycle \n2-4.  This caused some concerns because of week-end load swings \nandfluctuatingpower-plant loads.  However, eoc's were willing to establish a \ntechnical committee to work on a formula if theSocal Topock point gets \nresolved.\nRegarding pooling, El Paso is proposing to add 8 additional pools in the \nkeystone and 3 additonal pools in the san juan and 1 additional pool in the \nbondad.  This process is in its early stages of conflict.  Most people (Duke, \nSouthern, Williams, Coral)  are not on board with this.  I will keep you \nadvised of development.  Please advise if you have any questions.\n\n"}

{"from": "Jane M Tholt", "to": "Phillip K Allen", "content": "Below is a summary of the discussions last week regarding the complaint \nagainst El Paso for oversubscribing the Socal Topock Point.\nThe meeting started out by summarizing the dollar impact of the Border cuts \nto Amoco and Burlington of $3 million dollars and the additional fuel costs  \nof $15 million that they have incurred when the mainline fuel was reduced and \nthe gathering fuel was increased.  Accordingly, producers are seeking a \nminimum of $17  million in compensation in some form or  another.\nThe biggest concern is that a total of 1.2 bcf/day is being nominated at the \nSocal Topock which can only deliver 540000 mmbtu/day.   Socal Gas stated that \nthis problem should go away when there system becomes unbundled (referred to \nas Gatekeeper)..  The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could \nbe implemented as early as October 1, 2001.  When the Gatekeeper is \nimplemented  , only 540000 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the Socal Topock \nborder and must match up with the intra-state transport.  \nSoCal Gas suggested taking the 1.2 bcf/day of nominations at the Topock \ndelivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the \ncapapcity-  400 to Mohave; 540 to Socal Topock;  and 180 to PGE Topock.  They \nalso stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but  needed a minimum \nof 300 to meet core needs.  However, they wanted some type of compensation if \ntheir volume was reduced.   They also agreed to live with the status quo \nuntil the Gatekeeper was implemented.  This would result in firm rights being \nestablished at Socal Topock based on downstream rights.\nWilliams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a \nreduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment.\nAfter much discussion,  El Paso came back with the following counter proposal:\nRecommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented.
